		<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>4.1 - Introduction</h2><br />

		<div>
			The Zeitgeist Movement chapter structure is our official communication network worldwide, where the focus is on communication of TZM understandings and goals through voluntary awareness-activism efforts. Official Chapters are recognized as self-motivated groups of individuals who understand the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tenets and views, and advocate the solutions proposed in our materials. These local chapters are focused on on-the-ground awareness projects via coordinated group activity and social interaction.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			What makes our structure holographic is that each chapter advocates the same train of thought, reasoning and data-set, taking into account the cultural nuance of the population in that area (i.e. language, dominant political views, lifestyle and values, etc.), and finding effective and fun ways to communicate the train of thought to that area.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Chapters function via a network of efforts coordinated by volunteers (i.e. you) who choose to be part of the official structure, and participate by staying in communication with their TZM Coordinator, responding to email requests and organizing awareness events locally.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Note on &acirc;&euro;&oelig;official&acirc;&euro; versus &acirc;&euro;&oelig;non-official&acirc;&euro;: While this structure is what we call our &acirc;&euro;&oelig;official&acirc;&euro; platform for activism, it is not necessary to participate in activism in such a way. Some people don't have time, or may want to participate independently. Some may wish to create a group for other purposes (e.g. green movements, transition towns, building a city, access to socializing, etc.). These avenues are open to all, but are not what TZM Chapters are about. Please keep this in mind as you move forward. The current purpose of the Movement is awareness activism, education, and communication of the information in our materials aiming for a global, critical mass of supporters of a scientific value system.&nbsp;

		<div>
			<strong>I. Does a chapter already exist in your area?</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			There may already be a chapter in your area. To find this information, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com">www.thezeitgeistmovement.com</a> and scroll to the bottom of the page for links to countries, states and regions that have Chapters. Click through to see if a chapter may already exist, and, if so, join up with them!
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>II. If NO chapter exists in your area:</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Contact the coordinator for the next largest area in which you reside. For example, if I want to start a chapter in the city of Los Angeles, California, USA, I would look to see if there was a Los Angeles Chapter first. If the local chapter does not exist, then I would check for a state Chapter for California. If, again, no chapter is in existence, then I would contact the USA coordinator about starting a chapter. Your country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Chapter website may have a section entitled &acirc;&euro;&oelig;get involved&acirc;&euro;, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;start a chapter&acirc;&euro; or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;contact us&acirc;&euro; via which you will be able to start the process of inquiry.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			If you find there is no chapter in your region or country, check the global website to find out which global coordinator is most pertinent to your region. Initial questions can be sent to <script type="text/javascript">

		<div>
			<strong>III. Chapter Purpose:</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Our current purpose as Chapters is to engage in awareness-activism at city and local level. If you are interested in creating/coordinating a Chapter in your city, town or region, here are some guidelines to get started with:
		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>It is recommended to start with at least two people who wish to meet on a regular basis around the tenets of the Zeitgeist Movement, and who wish to engage in awareness activism.</li>

			<li>Coordinators must have an understanding of the <a target="_blank" href="http://zmca.org/images/stories/activist_orientation_guide.pdf">Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Orientation Guide</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3932487043163636261&amp;hl=en">Orientation Video</a>.</li>

			<li>Chapter activities must be relevant to the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s aims: Chapters exist to discuss and promote awareness of The Zeitgeist Movement and our shared set of understandings to the public.</li>

			<li>Official Chapters need to maintain a website for facilitating and managing membership and publicising events. We have a recommended Chapter platform, and can help get you online.</li>

			<li>We ask that any website used in an official capacity stay relevant to what TZM is about and the chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s activism efforts (i.e. no advertising of external organizations, projects or agendas as the website focus).</li>

			<li>It is recommended that Chapters host a meeting at least once a month to organize TZM awareness projects or events.</li>

			<li>Coordinators should participate in the online meeting of their &acirc;&euro;&tilde;next tier&acirc;&euro;&trade; Chapter (i.e. state, province, or international meeting). Usually these take place online in TeamSpeak. Connection information can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzmchapters.net/index.php/communication/voice-chat">Teamspeak Info</a>.</li>

			<li>Coordinators need to maintain communication with the coordinator for their larger area.</li>

			<li>It is necessary to keep networks well-connected. As an official chapter, link back to your parent chapter in acknowledgement of the connection. In addition your chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s site will be listed on the state/parent Chapter page.</li>
		</ul><br />

		<div>
			&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>As a Chapter Coordinator:</strong> You express, through your desire to take on the role, that you are in agreement with the above points regarding the role of a coordinator. Coordinator positions get re-posted as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;OPEN&acirc;&euro; if a coordinator becomes unresponsive to email requests, takes the chapter in a different direction than what TZM advocates (e.g. fighting other causes), and/or the chapter becomes dormant (i.e. there is little to no activity or communication).
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>IV. Your chapter is started, now what?&nbsp;</strong>
		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>You need a web platform - work with the coordinator who you contacted initially to create a web platform for your Chapter (if needed)</li>

			<li>Create your next awareness activism event and put in on your Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Calendar! Some examples are:

				<ul>
					<li>Hand out DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s or TZM flyers at a festival, market or fair</li>

					<li>Hold a screening of Moving Forward or Addendum</li>

					<li>Create a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zmca.org/take-action/what-can-i-do/256-qwhy-i-advocateq-media-campaign">"Why I Advocate"</a> video</li>

					<li>Leave cards, brochures or DVDs with public business outlets to make available to customers</li>

					<li>Participate in the next global event, for example Z-day or the Zeitgeist Media Festival</li>

					<li>Engage other organizations and movements regarding the Zeitgeist Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s train of thought (through talks, screenings, teach-ins, etc)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Create content from your Chapter efforts; examples include written articles, photos, and videos posted online. Photos and videos of your events and efforts are important for the sake of demonstrating and recording the activity of your Chapter.</li>

			<li>Bring that content to the TZM meetings you attend (e.g. USA or international Chapter meeting in TeamSpeak) so it can be re-published.</li>

			<li>Being in communication is fundamental to creating a globally networked movement. Therefore it is important to stay in communication with the Chapter coordinator at the next tier up from yourself (usually your province, state, or national coordinator).</li>
		</ul><br />

		<div>
			<strong>V. Chapter Resources</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			The following resources are likely to be of use in ensuring your Chapter members are conversant with the aims and ethos of the Movement and fully understand the concept and goal of a Resource-Based Economic Model. It is of great importance that the core team of any Chapter be confident in their ability to convey these concepts and aims as they are likely to interface with the public. The various media resources compiled as an ongoing project also greatly assist in the task of conveying the message of the Movement.

		<div>
			<strong>VI. Maintaining a Chapter</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Consistency:</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			It is important to have consistent activism on a monthly basis as a minimum as consistency helps maintain momentum. A calendar is a great tool for this as it enables members to keep up to date with when activities are taking place, to ensure their availability, and to prepare themselves if any preparation is deemed necessary. This consistency also facilitates the integration of activism into an individual&acirc;&euro;&trade;s established lifestyle and schedule, particularly for those who are very busy. Consistency and momentum also allow members to feel that development of the Chapter is being made and that steps are being taken that will lead toward positive outcomes. If activity is allowed to stagnate this can have a very negative impact on the motivation and commitment of members.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			If a Chapter is slow-moving, or is not increasing in size at a reassuring pace, it can be difficult to maintain enthusiasm. However, it is important not to rush the process of building a solid Chapter, and to instead establish a consistent routine that is fulfilling for those who are committed to their involvement. Do not spend too much time on the measure of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;size&acirc;&euro; when it comes to activism. Start small and engage in actions that are within the means and resources you have available. Let relevance combined with consistency of action take priority over size (* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzmchapters.net/index.php/chapters/guide#1.3.%20Getting%20Real%20with%20Expectations">see section on Expectations</a>), and allow your Chapter to develop at a pace that is realistic and manageable for your members. &nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<h2><a name="raising-volunteers" id="raising-volunteers"></a>4.3 - Raising Volunteers &amp; Organizing a Core Group</h2><br />

		<div>
			The backbone of any Chapter within the Movement is its core team of active volunteers. Regardless the size of the Chapter as a whole, or the region it is based in, the Chapter core consists usually of a small group of committed activists. You will find that members come and go, attending meetings and events sporadically, or perhaps consistently for a period of time, and then disappear. This is not something to be concerned about as it is the norm in any activist group. Your area of greatest need is your core team, and the need to differentiate between those members who may form your core from other members is of great relevance when it comes to ensuring your expectations are realistic.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Raising Volunteers</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			It can feel lonely starting out with a new Chapter and the task of raising enough volunteers to help out consistently may appear daunting. However, a few online tools should be of great help to get you started.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			You need to establish a virtual presence either via your country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s national website, or by establishing your own site (in many cases there is no need to do this as local Chapters enjoy space on their country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s national website). It is important to regularly post news and updates regarding your Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s activity to this website so that you are maintaining a public online presence. While there is no need to advertise every closed planning meeting your Chapter has it is helpful to at least make monthly posts to the website outlining upcoming Chapter activities and events that would-be volunteers may like to get involved with.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			This process of publicising your activity should be replicated on a variety of platforms in order to achieve maximum reach. This means that you will need an active social media presence via Facebook, Twitter, and the like. You may wish to have your own Chapter page for the sake of appealing specifically to those in your immediate area, therefore. Be careful with social media, however, as, although it is a useful publicity tool it is not a reliable measure of a Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s activity as much of what happens on social media platforms does not translate to on-the-ground activism. A Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Facebook page, for example, may attract hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of followers, yet yield little in the way of volunteering when it comes to holding actual offline meetings and events. Avoid getting bogged down in discussions that are based in social media as these can become a drain on your limited resources and often bear little relevance to what is
			happening with your actual, as opposed to virtual, Chapter.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			If you have access to a mailing list or are able to set one up this will also prove useful in targeting volunteers who may previously have been dormant supporters of the Movement. It is a good idea to post information to your website and mailing list at least a week prior to the period in which the meetings and events outlined begins so that would-be volunteers are able to make plans to support their attendance. With mailing lists it may be best to provide an outline of a month&acirc;&euro;&trade;s activities in one go rather than feeding information in a piecemeal manner that can come across as spamming. You may experience slow progress with building your mailing list if you rely only on your website for sign-ups. It is important to engage in on-the-ground public interface and outreach via meetings and events, no matter how small to begin with, in order to grow your member base of potential Chapter volunteers.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			You may wish to reach out to other nearby Chapters as well, especially if members have previously been travelling in order to attend meetings in a nearby town due to having had no local Chapter activity to engage in. In Australia, for example, a number of local Chapters started as a result of members, having attended meetings or events in cities a few hours&acirc;&euro;&trade; travelling distance from their home, decided to take the courageous next step of reaching out to their own community and setting up a new Chapter. It is often the case that other people in the area are very keen to get involved but were waiting for someone else to be the one to set things up. National or regional Chapter coordinators may even be able to provide you with contact details of people who have expressed interest in engaging with Chapter activity in your area prior to the establishment of your Chapter but who were unable to take on the task of coordination themselves.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Once you have an active online presence and strong lines of communication you will attract a pool of potential volunteers who will contribute to the development of your Chapter. It is vitally important that you do not neglect this member base as remaining in constant communication allows you the momentum to enthuse and motivate your Chapter. It is also important to get into a routine as quickly as possible with your Chapter so that activity within the Movement becomes a part of your volunteers&acirc;&euro;&trade; lifestyle.
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<div>
			<strong>Core Team</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			You will likely find that when there are large events taking place a number of volunteers who are not highly involved in the Movement will help out for a period of time in a more active manner. However, the more committed volunteers who form your core team for planning purposes will be those who endeavour to come to every meeting and are willing to help out with whatever needs doing whether it is of an empowering nature, such as facilitating meetings, or work of a less empowering nature considered grunt work that nobody really relishes doing, such as flyer runs for events.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			It is this core team who enable the Chapter to run in both a horizontal and holographic manner. Distributing tasks and responsibilities as evenly as possible across your core team assists both with facilitating the horizontal nature of the Movement, and with alleviating the pressure a coordinator may feel, particularly when it comes to major events or projects. It is also a good idea to be purposeful in distributing tasks among the core team in accordance with interests and skills in order to provide members with a sense of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;place&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;purpose&acirc;&euro; within the team as well as a sense of responsibility and commitment.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			As the core team are the backbone of your Chapter it is important to have strong lines of communication between these members. Although it is unlikely that everyone has optimal interpersonal relations it is of importance to build a sense of team spirit and camaraderie between core members in order that everyone feels valued and appreciated for the work that they do, and has a sense of enjoyment in engaging with the rest of the team.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Various online tools assist with smooth functioning of core team activities. For example, using communication and project-planning platforms such as Open Atrium are useful for core-team communication and development. Using file storage systems such as Dropbox enables the sharing of useful resources. Collaborative documents such as google-docs are also useful for both the transparency they provide and ease of collaboration regardless of time or location.&nbsp;
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<div>
			<strong>Common Concerns &amp; Pitfalls:&nbsp;</strong>
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<div>
			<strong>Stay Flexible:&nbsp;</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Not every chapter succeeds or stays in existence once formed. Sometimes the person who starts a chapter has to leave, or perhaps move on, for various reasons (e.g. health, time, job, or they come to realize they want to support a different group, etc). Finding a new coordinator, point person or core-group is something that is likely to happen in many Chapters, although hopefully not all at once! Part of coordinating is understanding that these changes are natural, and allowing for them since volunteers come and go. The horizontal nature of the Movement is an asset in maintaining flexibility as such a structure facilitates empowerment of the team in fulfilling the necessary tasks of an active Chapter. A committed core team in a healthy, horizontally structured Chapter may, therefore, find stand-ins on either a short-term or long-term basis without difficulty as and when core members need to take time out or move on, or be adaptable to changes within the make-up of the Chapter
			with minimal disruption of activity.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Disruptive People:</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Do not underestimate the power of a disruptive website or forum user or Chapter member. A person who persists in disruptive action over time is known as a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;troll&acirc;&euro;. Unfortunately, not everyone who refers to themselves as a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;supporter&acirc;&euro; or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;member&acirc;&euro; will actually support the Chapter in its activities, or have a relevant understanding of the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s aims and ethos. It is likely that you will, at some point, come across a person who will continually disrupt your chapter meetings, forums or websites. This usually takes place through pushing an outside cause, or via attacks on the awareness-raising focus of the Movement, or projection of an unrelated frame of reference (e.g. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;this is communism&acirc;&euro;, or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;we need to be &acirc;&euro;&oelig;voting&acirc;&euro; on things&acirc;&euro;), or some other patchwork notion. This is known as
			"noise&acirc;&euro;, and our intention is to minimize the noise-level within our Chapter structure that can diffuse the focus of our efforts, and maximize the signal level (educational imperatives to the public).
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note on being a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;member&acirc;&euro;:</strong></em>
		</div>

		<div>
			<em>By referring to oneself as a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;TZM member&acirc;&euro; it implies agreement (a priori) with the direction advocated. This statement will be useful if you find yourself struggling with a disruptive member. If you intend to have a forum, blog/comment system, Facebook group or chat, make sure you have someone willing to moderate Chapter platforms. The last thing you want is a soapbox of personal attacks, irrelevant material, spam, etc. confusing the message. This not only affects your Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s public image, but also destroys the Chapter community and stops productivity.</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note on websites:&nbsp;</strong></em>
		</div>

		<div>
			<em>The website in itself is not your Chapter, it is just a tool. Your real Chapter consists of people. A website, no matter how good-looking it may or may not be, can help maintain and grow your chapter effectively. If you have a non-functional organization within your core group, it will inhibit the way resources are used and tasks are done.&nbsp;</em>
		</div>
