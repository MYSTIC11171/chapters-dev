		<div>
			Getting volunteers to help out in <em>any</em> chapter creation is an important asset in creating a strong chapter. At the national level, while technically only one person is required to set up the structure for a national chapter, it is very important to acquire all additional help possible.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In order to maximize your chances of having someone help you out initially in chapter creation, an important first step here is to find out if anything or anyone is <em>already in place</em> as any kind of Zeitgeist Movement entity within your country. You can do the following:
		</div><br />

		<h4>- Query the chapters administration</h4>

		<div>
			Assuming you haven't already done so, email the Global Chapters Administration (GCA) at <script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[

		</div><br />

		<h4>- Search for any groups or pages on social networking websites</h4>

		<div>
			This one is pretty straightforward, for example: do a facebook search with possible search terms for a Zeitgeist Movement group in your country, for example &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist [Your Country]&acirc;&euro; or "Zeitgeist Movement" translated into your local language. If you get any matches you should try to get in touch with the page admin (if it is a page), send a private message (if it is a profile account) and/or post your help request (if it is a group).
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Other known social networking sites include: Google+, Twitter, Myspace, etc. Do not forget to check if there is a group with your country/region/city name on the TZM Network website (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzmnetwork.com/">http://www.tzmnetwork.com/</a>).
		</div><br />

		<h4>- Do a google Search</h4>

		<div>
			While it is pretty rare, it is still possible that you can track useful information by doing a google search using search terms such as those mentioned above. You might find that someone held an event in your country and promoted it in their blog, or that someone has already started to build a website and has not yet contacted the GCA ( <script type="text/javascript">

		<h4>- Query the Linguistic Team</h4>

		<div>
			In the Linguistic Team, sometimes there are active translators from countries that have no chapter. Sending an email to the Linguistic Team ( <script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
			var prefix='&amp;#109;a'+'i&amp;#108;'+'&amp;#116;o';var path='hr'+'ef'+'=';var addy33713='l&amp;#105;ng&amp;#117;&amp;#105;st&amp;#105;ct&amp;#101;&amp;#97;m'+'&amp;#64;';addy33713=addy33713+'gm&amp;#97;&amp;#105;l'+'&amp;#46;'+'c&amp;#111;m';var addy_text33713='l&amp;#105;ng&amp;#117;&amp;#105;st&amp;#105;ct&amp;#101;&amp;#97;m'+'&amp;#64;'+'gm&amp;#97;&amp;#105;l'+'&amp;#46;'+'c&amp;#111;m';document.write('&lt;a '+path+'\''+prefix+':'+addy33713+'\'&gt;');document.write(addy_text33713);document.write('&lt;\/a&gt;');

			//]]>
			</script></span>) may get you those contacts that can later on be a very valuable asset in helping with the future development of your chapter.
		</div><br />

		<h4>- Your own "community"</h4>

		<div>
			Some chapters start out with a group of friends that want to do something. If you feel your friends or relatives support the Movement, perhaps you could ask them to join in and help you.
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<div>
			<em>After you have done your "scouting" by performing the steps described above, you are advised to do the following:</em>
		</div>

		<h4>- Establish a Facebook Page&nbsp;</h4>

		<div>
			Create a facebook page, upload a logo, add some apps like a welcome page, and feed it content about the Movement in the region and/or mirror some news/updates from the TZM Global page on facebook.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note:</strong> Avoid setting up a profile account for the chapter, such action goes against facebook TOS (Terms of Service) and may result in your profile being de-activated from facebook.</em>
		</div>

		<h4>- Establish a Twitter Account</h4>

		<div>
			This is also pretty simple: create an account, edit the profile accordingly (add logo, edit URL, etc.). As a bonus you can connect your twitter account to your facebook account; this way one post in facebook or twitter gets automatically mirrored in both.
		</div>

		<h4>- Establish a Youtube Channel</h4>

		<div>
			This is pretty straightforward: create a channel, upload some videos that might already be translated into your language. You might want to be a YouTube partner to enable longer video duration in your channel (in the footer links on the youtube homepage, click &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Creators &amp; Partners&acirc;&euro;). After you have done this, email GCA at <script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
			var prefix='&amp;#109;a'+'i&amp;#108;'+'&amp;#116;o';var path='hr'+'ef'+'=';var addy84355='ch&amp;#97;pt&amp;#101;rs'+'&amp;#64;';addy84355=addy84355+'th&amp;#101;z&amp;#101;&amp;#105;tg&amp;#101;&amp;#105;stm&amp;#111;v&amp;#101;m&amp;#101;nt'+'&amp;#46;'+'c&amp;#111;m';var addy_text84355='ch&amp;#97;pt&amp;#101;rs'+'&amp;#64;'+'th&amp;#101;z&amp;#101;&amp;#105;tg&amp;#101;&amp;#105;stm&amp;#111;v&amp;#101;m&amp;#101;nt'+'&amp;#46;'+'c&amp;#111;m';document.write('&lt;a '+path+'\''+prefix+':'+addy84355+'\'&gt;');document.write(addy_text84355);document.write('&lt;\/a&gt;');

			</script></span> so your channel can later be linked to the TZM Official Channel.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note:</strong> Please respect Youtube&acirc;&euro;&trade;s copyright infringement guidelines; your channel may be negatively affected permanently and your partner status immediately revoked otherwise.</em>
		</div>

		<h4>- Other Social Networking Sites</h4>

		<div>
			You can also join up with other social network sites that may have success in your country. Just be sure to have a small workflow in your head or noted down regarding the order in which you will update content on your social media, because the more you have, the more you will have to repeat the same action each time you want to send an update.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>A Parting Note on Help:</strong> When asking for help from GCA, try to be as specific as you can. For example, try to detail some aspects where you need help, such as working with the website, working with images, working with translations, etc. In addition, where appropriate, address people by name personally, and, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;To:&acirc;&euro; one person and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Cc:&acirc;&euro; others. This way you reduce the chances of being affected by the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;diffusion of responsibility effect&acirc;&euro; (See &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Organizing a Core Group&acirc;&euro; for more info).</em>
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<h3><a name="2.2. Establishing a Website &amp; Tools"></a>2.2. Establishing a Website &amp; Tools</h3>

		<div>
			After establishing your social media and getting some help you should then proceed with setting up the base of your chapter, the website.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Where would we be without the Internet? We all recognize the importance of this powerful tool in the organization of activist groups and the facilitation of communicating the message to a wider audience. It is extremely important, therefore, to establish a website to provide such information.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The website will be your point of reference where new visitors will learn about the Movement in their region and language; where supporters will be kept up to date with the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s news; and where interested members will be able to contribute, to join, to communicate, and to organize.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note:</strong> As part of your chapter website structural design, a longer-term goal to keep in mind is expansion into regional chapter pages and possibly their own websites.</em>
		</div><br />

		<h4>Acquiring a good Domain (or several)</h4>

		<div>
			Before actually starting to build the website, first you must acquire a domain. These can run really cheap nowadays with domains like <a target="_blank" href="http://tzm-usa.org">tzm-usa.org</a> costing less than $10 per year. When choosing a domain it is best to go for something that describes the chapter clearly; an example for Spain would be:
		</div><br />

		<div>
			- movimientozeitgeist.es &lt; The Zeitgeist Movement is translated and the domain extension corresponds to the the country - &acirc;&euro;&oelig;es&acirc;&euro; stands for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Spain&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			However, extensions like <u>.org</u> are fine, and are probably the cheaper ones to register.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			- zeitgeistspain.org &lt; Simply the word zeitgeist and the country the chapter is from, is also a decent domain.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			There are, of course, other possible domains.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			As an extra, you might want to buy two domains and/or get a third one to host your public campaign pages. Something like zday.es is much easier to remember, and to, for example, put in a flyer, than movimientozeitgeist.es. However, with all lesser domains you could also configure them to redirect to the main one, or at a minimum provide a link to it.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note:</strong> When utilizing a domain specific for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;campaigns,&acirc;&euro; you need to redirect to a specific page of information about whatever you are promoting.</em>
		</div><br />

		<h4>Building the Website</h4>

		<div>
			Currently, a template is available from GCA that has most of the content structured and a good level of website functionality. It is relatively easy to manage if you are not acquainted with web development, and it also looks professional with a clean design. Contact GCA for this template ( <script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
			var prefix='&amp;#109;a'+'i&amp;#108;'+'&amp;#116;o';var path='hr'+'ef'+'=';var addy12923='ch&amp;#97;pt&amp;#101;rs'+'&amp;#64;';addy12923=addy12923+'th&amp;#101;z&amp;#101;&amp;#105;tg&amp;#101;&amp;#105;stm&amp;#111;v&amp;#101;m&amp;#101;nt'+'&amp;#46;'+'c&amp;#111;m';var addy_text12923='ch&amp;#97;pt&amp;#101;rs'+'&amp;#64;'+'th&amp;#101;z&amp;#101;&amp;#105;tg&amp;#101;&amp;#105;stm&amp;#111;v&amp;#101;m&amp;#101;nt'+'&amp;#46;'+'c&amp;#111;m';document.write('&lt;a '+path+'\''+prefix+':'+addy12923+'\'&gt;');document.write(addy_text12923);document.write('&lt;\/a&gt;');

		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Preview</strong>: <a href="http://tzmchapters.co.cc/template">http://tzmchapters.co.cc/template</a>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			With the template you have three options:
		</div>

		<div>
			a. Follow the instructions and use it in your chapter.
		</div>

		<div>
			b. Use it as a starting point and expand the functionality, etc.
		</div>

		<div>
			c. Develop your own site but keep the template as a main reference for the level of content structuring and functionality it offers.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Naturally each option has its own requirement of web development skill and knowledge.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Feel free to build upon the template or be creative in building your own; however, please maintain the minimum guidelines stated in the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Movement Policies&acirc;&euro; section near the end of this document.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			For a chapter website to be effective, it needs to have several features, including:
		</div>

		<div>
			- a good professional looking design, along with easy access to information
		</div>

		<div>
			- a dynamic aspect, i.e., regular content updates, current news, etc.
		</div>

		<div>
			- some kind of medium where users can communicate with each other, e.g., blog, forum, chat, etc.
		</div><br />

		<p><strong>Important aspects to keep in mind</strong></p>

		<div>
			- Do not underestimate the power of disruptive users (also known as trolls).&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			If you are intending to have a forum, blog/comment system or chat, make sure you have people willing to moderate and work to expand the team. The last thing you want is a soapbox of personal attacks, irrelevant material, spam, etc. This not only affects your public image, but also does a damn good job of quickly &acirc;&euro;&oelig;destroying&acirc;&euro; the virtual community you worked to build and maintain.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			- Put yourself in your visitor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s mindset when navigating your website.&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			You don't want to deter your visitors from learning or helping by having information &acirc;&euro;&oelig;gaps&acirc;&euro; or confusing navigation. Most of the time, the simpler the navigation and page layout, the better.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			- The website in itself is not your chapter, it is just a tool.&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			Your real chapter is your members, and no website -- no matter how good looking and functional -- can help maintain and grow your chapter effectively if you have a non-functional organizational and communication structure between your core group for handling resources and the flow of tasks.
		</div><br />

		<h4>Establishing Tools</h4>

		<div>
			Simultaneously, as you work to establish your website, you should also prioritize setting up the base tools that your core group and future active chapter members will utilize for organizing documents, files, tasks, etc.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			These tools are fairly quick and easy to set up. Their utility, benefit, and success depends upon the working &acirc;&euro;&oelig;mindset&acirc;&euro; of your core group, and the constructive synergy between you and the group.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>A Document System</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			This is a tool that will be an important backbone of the chapter core and all projects that develop. While it is possible to manage a chapter and its organization without this, there are strong advantages of having a centralized and organized document system.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			With a document system like google docs, you can have all of them organized in folders and always find something without having to ask for the link or bookmark it. You can also share documents with several people and work in a collaborative manner with common tasks such as creating forms, spreadsheets, text documents, slideshow presentations, etc.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In order to set up a folder for your chapter just send an email to GCA at <script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[

		<div>
			<strong>A Project Management System</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Setting up a Project Management System (PMS) can be very useful for your chapter, especially as it grows larger, harboring several projects at the same time.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			There are dozens if not hundreds of possible solutions in this area; however, Open Atrium has been known and used in the Movement by several chapters and teams for the tools and functionality it offers as well as its ease of use. Open Atrium is an open-source platform designed specifically to make great teams communicate better. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s an intranet in a box with the following features: a blog, a wiki, a calendar, a to do list, a shoutbox, and a dashboard to manage it all. A &acirc;&euro;&oelig;tailored&acirc;&euro; Open Atrium installation package with base examples of chapter and project organization is currently bundled as an extra in the TZM Chapters Template.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note:</strong> Do not assume that a PMS is an answer to your organization problems: a good PMS won't save you from poor organization and/or work discipline, or a lack thereof.</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>A File Storage system</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			As soon as your chapter starts growing there will be a larger need to have a common place where files are stored and organized. These files may have several ends and purposes; however, most of their use will be to transfer project files and to host files that are frequently downloaded from the chapter site, thus saving you the load from your personal hosting. Having a common file storage system is very easy and there are plenty of choices. Depending on your needs, you can choose what you think will be best for you and your chapter. Some of the more common services used by chapters in the Movement are Dropbox and Mediafire.
		</div><br />
		<br />

		<h3><a name="2.3. Organizing a Core Group"></a>2.3. Organizing a Core Group</h3>

		<div>
			As we all know it is not enough to have a group of people who just want to help. There must be a mechanism for them to be able to help efficiently and in an organized way, and with that goal in mind we reach the step where a core needs to be established.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Before going into detail on how to form a core, here are a few important key points:
		</div><br />

		<h4>What is synchronous and asynchronous activity?</h4>

		<div>
			Very simply, synchronous activity requires the participants to be at a given place and time working on something together, whereas an asynchronous activity is one that any participant can work on, whenever they wish, at a time of their choosing, regardless of the activity of others.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			An example of a synchronous activity is a physical meeting. A gathering of a group of individuals who can discuss topics in a physical meeting (face-to-face) has its advantages. However, gathering "around a table" is not always possible for all who wish to participate due to conflict of schedules, personal obligations and agendas, and so on. Face-to-face gatherings also exclude those who wish to attend and contribute but live at too great a distance from the meeting location. &nbsp;&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			This is where online meetings come in. Establishing an online presence serves to strengthen the interaction of the team due to the continuity provided beyond the physical meetings. It also allows one to participate discreetly from the comfort of one's home, creating an environment independent of time-space variables and allowing &acirc;&euro;&oelig;asynchronous&acirc;&euro; participation. For example, a member can contribute with ideas at 3 p.m. and another one can continue the work at 3 a.m.
		</div><br />

		<h4>What is the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;diffusion of responsibility&acirc;&euro; effect and why is it so important?</h4>

		<div>
			Diffusion of responsibility is a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for an action or inaction when others are present. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that, either others are responsible for taking action, or have already done so. The phenomenon tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size and when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. It rarely occurs when the person is alone; diffusion tends to increase with groups of three or more.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			This effect happens more frequently than we might think. Within the Movement, it has manifested in various ways:
		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>No productivity or follow-up after a great idea/discussion because no one took responsibility to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;own it&acirc;&euro; or apply it.</li>

			<li>No follow-up or organizational execution after some great tasks and roles were discussed in the meeting. This can happen whenever the project is managed by two or more persons, or if members reject the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;manager role.&acirc;&euro;</li>

			<li>Few replies when mass-emailing and asking for volunteers. It has been discovered that asking individually (or at least giving the impression of doing so) seems to produce substantially more positive results.</li>
		</ul><br />

		<div>
			Understanding and identifying this effect is critical in activism since it can make a difference between being only all talk and no results or actually taking effective action. You can search and read more about this phenomenon via Wikipedia if you are interested in learning more.

		<p><strong>Forming a Chapter Core</strong></p>

		<div>
			When forming a chapter core the following key aspects should be considered:
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>- Defining the Chapter Coordination and Responsibilities</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			First and foremost, when defining the core of the Chapter you must start with Chapter coordination. Without this your Chapter will fall into permanent disorganization because of the simple fact that there is no responsibility on anyone to do any of the core tasks of maintaining and developing the Chapter.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			So what does a Chapter coordinator actually do? S/he:
		</div>

		<div>
			a) organizes and manages information within the chapter (including reports and meetings)
		</div>

		<div>
			b) stays informed of Movement activity, and informs other Chapter tiers and members
		</div>

		<div>
			c) supports and provides counseling to project managers within the Chapter
		</div>

		<div>
			d) reviews and validates sub-chapters, coordinators and project proposals in the Chapter
		</div>

		<div>
			e) ensures the accuracy and integrity of Movement representation throughout the Chapter website and activism
		</div>

		<div>
			f) is responsible for the appropriate use and privacy of the Chapter mailing list and other important administrative data
		</div>

		<div>
			g) pursues a conflict-free work-oriented environment, and, if necessary, acts as a mediator within the Chapter
		</div>

		<div>
			h) manages the Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s email address list
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note:</strong> You can read more about coordination in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzmchapters.net/index.php/appendix#tips-from-coordinators">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Tips from Coordinators&acirc;&euro; section</a> in the online version of the guide (website based).</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>- Chapters with subchapters</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			In larger Chapters with subchapters, a coordinator must also focus on supporting and growing them, the development of their projects, and maintaining a good information flow.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>- Multiple coordinators</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			In the case of multiple coordinators, you must ask your team the following questions:
		</div>

		<div>
			- Who is going to help in the development of subchapters?
		</div>

		<div>
			- Who is going to integrate project management and make sure projects are developing properly?
		</div>

		<div>
			- Who is going to maintain and keep current the Chapter and subchapter websites?
		</div>

		<div>
			- Who is going to organize Chapter meetings, gather and organize reports, interact with the global movement by reporting and relaying the information back and forth?
		</div><br />

		<div>
			As can be seen above, it is important to make it very clear who is responsible for what. Assign someone the task of checking that the items that each person has taken responsibility for are being done, and if not, why not, and what alternative solutions might be available. In other words, this person will have the role of internal group management.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>- Defining the Linguistic Team</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			In a national Chapter, the Linguistic Team is of fundamental importance, especially in countries where the native language is not English. A lack of available content in a given native language invariably leads to the inadvertent exclusion of people who might not understand English very well, and content that is incorrectly translated often leads to a lack of understanding and/or incorrect interpretations.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The Linguistic Team already provides the coordination, tools, maintenance and experience needed for your Chapter to quickly get involved and become productive as soon as your group is ready to hook in. In most cases, an official Language Team will already exist for your language, along with their progress report showing everything that has already been completed, as well as a listing of fully prepped English materials that are yet to be started for translation (Note that all materials must first pass through the LingTeam&acirc;&euro;&trade;s English Department for proofreading before they are available for translation).

			<div>
				<br />

				<div>
					It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s necessary for chapter coordinators to identify members who are able to assist with the following tasks: translating, proofreading, fully coordinating with the official LingTeam coordinator(s) and relaying relevant information back to project participants from your chapter, helping new members, making sure translations are progressing, keeping track of human resources, etc.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					Usually when Chapters start, the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;translations liason role&acirc;&euro; is entrusted to a single person; however, as the Chapter grows it may need to be expanded into a 2 or 3 person coordination effort. In this case it is VERY important to define the sub-role of each coordinator. All role definitions need to be coordinated with the official LingTeam coordinator(s), as they are the ones responsible for overseeing all activities within the language team.
				</div><br />

				</div><br />

				<div>
					<strong>- Defining the Multimedia Team</strong>
				</div>

				<div>
					Unlike the Linguistic Team, it is very likely that this is going to be less a team, and more an area of responsibility which one or a small group of members take on. Very simply, the multimedia aspect has to do with carrying out tasks that are related to graphic design and video and audio editing.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					This is important because public image is a large and important part of the Movement as a whole. If you can have professionally produced content in flyers, posters and suchlike, you will immediately be treated with a lot more credibility. Likewise, not everyone in the Movement is a professional graphic designer or knows how to work with such tools effectively. By having this process centralized and easy to copy/adapt you can save a tremendous amount of headache and resources while still looking good.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					<strong>- Defining the PR Team</strong>
				</div>

				<div>
					The PR Team stands for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Public Relations&acirc;&euro;. PR is the area of activity that includes writing, public speaking, and improving the communication/public image of the chapter by brainstorming and proposing activism campaigns for local Chapters to take on.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					As with the other teams, the PR team needs someone to organize it and the sooner this person is identified, the better.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					The people who initially join this team will be important as, not only will they ideally be better suited than the average active member to the role, but will also &nbsp;develop a system for the handling of mass media by communicating the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s understandings efficiently. Usually people who participate in these roles are involved with marketing, public relations, teaching, sales, customer service, etc.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					<strong>- Defining the Workflow of Human Resources: &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Teams&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Projects&acirc;&euro;</strong>
				</div>

				<div>
					With regard to the issue of structuring, a very important question is often overlooked, which is: Should your Chapter have teams with associated projects, or have projects under which several teams work?
				</div><br />

				<div>
					Given the nature of volunteerism in the Movement, building a team is really hard work because active members come and go and may return later or not at all (depending on the status of their personal lives), and either they took satisfaction from the work they did, or did not. Having such a team with responsibility for organizing team-specific projects puts tremendous strain on the team&acirc;&euro;&trade;s organizer(s), and further, given the nature of some projects, sometimes interdisciplinary skills are required. Analyzing this situation and observing the brief history of teams within the Movement, it seems clear that teams with projects &nbsp;operating &acirc;&euro;&oelig;under them&acirc;&euro; don't seem to work very effectively.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					Fortunately, framing projects as catalysts to form temporary teams that come from the resource base or pool (maintained by the teams&acirc;&euro;&trade; facilitators) seems to generate better results. The formula is very simple; it consists of defining an objective and then reasoning, gathering volunteers and organizing tasks, accomplishing those tasks and finishing the project.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					In this scenario the role of the team is not obsolete; it is actually quite the opposite. A team from a given discipline serves as a resource base to form multidisciplinary teams that will work on a project. For example, project X requires 1 graphic designer, 1 programmer, and 2 translators. This means that the Media Team organizer will inform all eligible members from his/her database, and will try to secure a volunteer for the role, and this same method applies, in this example, to Development and Linguistic Teams.
				</div><br />

				<div>
					<em><strong>Note:</strong> There is an exception to this rule; the linguistic team seems to hang pretty well by itself in either method since the workflow is very standardized (proofread, translate, review and publish). This may indicate that the more simplified and repeatable your workflow, the more successful it may become.</em>
				</div><br />

				<h3><a name="2.4. Expanding into Regional Chapters"></a>2.4. Expanding into Regional Chapters</h3>

				<div>
					The goal of a national Chapter coordinator is to help regional coordinators develop Chapters by providing useful resources and a platform for the sharing of ideas and mutual support &nbsp;via regular online meetings. In addition, national coordinators are responsible for passing along information from global meetings on activism that is happening on a global scale, such as global events (for example: Z-Day, Zeitgeist Media Festival, etc) and special awareness campaigns (for example: Why I Advocate, Zeitgeist Media Project, ZeitNews, etc).
				</div><br />

				<div>
					Regional/State Coordinators:
				</div>

				<ul>
					<li>Live in the nation/state they are coordinating</li>

					<li>Are very familiar with the Zeitgeist movies, the Activist Orientation Guide and Peter Joseph lectures, and &nbsp;feel comfortable answering questions about a global, resource-based economic model and why it is both necessary and desirable</li>

					<li>Have regular access to a computer and email correspondence</li>

					<li>Are actual supporters who are knowledgeable of, and dedicated to, the direction of the movement</li>

					<li>Are solution-oriented thinkers who thrive on collaborative projects and keeping others motivated</li>

					<li>Feel comfortable doing a lot of event coordination in their local area, including screenings, town hall meetings, street and festival activism, etc.</li>
				</ul><br />

				<div>
					Regional/state coordinators are volunteers who relay TZM information shared from global/national coordinators to members within their respective state/region. They hold meetings (online, in-person, or both), update website content, send newsletters, answer emails from members and other coordinators, sometimes organize local activist events, may assist in the development of city and university sub-chapters, participate in monthly Chapter reporting, may speak on behalf of the Movement at local events and attend national Chapter meetings via TeamSpeak to keep up to date with Movement initiatives (if their schedule does not permit live meeting participation, they catch up via post-meeting recordings).
				</div><br />

				<div>
					You know you are ready to expand into a regional Chapter when someone shows an interest in taking on the role, fits the qualifications needed for the role, and is committed to the responsibilities of that role. There may be people who demonstrate an interest in establishing Chapter activity in their area who are, however, not suitable for the role - perhaps because they lack the necessary communication skills, are not sufficiently confident in conveying the aims and ethos of the Movement and RBEM concept, or, perhaps, because they have an alternative agenda that may lead to a conflict of interest. It is important to be discerning when preparing new people for coordination roles as if you do not get the right kind of person this could be potentially damaging for the Chapter, and, in turn, the Movement as a whole.
