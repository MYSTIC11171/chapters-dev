		<div>
			One of the best ways for a local community Chapter to access multitudes of people and spread the information of the Zeitgeist Movement is through local street activism, community events, community fairs, and festivals.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In every city there are many different types of events that happen throughout the year and many of these events are extremely open and welcoming to organizations that are humanitarian or environmentally-based in their fundamental ideas and basic foundations.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			At these types of events it is not uncommon to share the day with other like-minded groups that have a strong desire and commitment to create awareness on a mass scale.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			There are three important factors to keep in mind when setting up your Chapter for such events:
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<div>
				<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;The other groups that attend these events are already in the right mindset for the information that you have and will be very easy to talk to. Ranging from animal rights and human rights organizations to environmental and political organizations, engaging these individuals in conversation is easy to do and opens the doors to people that will be very receptive to the Zeitgeist Movement.
			</div>

			<div>
				<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;2.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;These types of events draw crowds into the thousands that are very open-minded, and, in many ways, have already been looking at many different forms of information on a wide range of topics that are political and environmental in nature. These are not difficult people to talk to. At the end of the day many will take home with them a DVD or a flyer that your group has made. They will research and view the material and many will pass this &acirc;&euro;&oelig;new found&acirc;&euro; knowledge onto their circle of friends.
			</div>

			<div>
				<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;3.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;You will be a visual presence within your community. Many members or "sign-ups" from your chapter will come out to your booth to meet &acirc;&euro;&oelig;their&acirc;&euro; Zeitgeist team. Many others will want to know how they can get involved. When people read the materials and connect with &nbsp;the &nbsp;message&nbsp; they &nbsp;have &nbsp;a &nbsp;strong &nbsp;desire &nbsp;to &nbsp;&acirc;&euro;&oelig;get &nbsp;involved&acirc;&euro;.&nbsp; People &nbsp;want &nbsp;to &nbsp;do something. Yes, they can join the many online forums around the world and speak with others who have connected with the message, but many people want more. They want to take action. This can ONLY be done at the local level!
			</div>

			<p>Your presence as a Chapter within your community, on the street at these events, is the perfect opportunity for others to see the Movement in action. It is also a solid way for people to feel connected to real living, breathing human beings within the Movement. This is something that just can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be fully achieved &acirc;&euro;&oelig;online.&acirc;&euro; As connected as we are with our worldwide online Zeitgeist family, nothing beats face-to-face discussion on the issues and concepts that we are dedicated to spreading.</p>

			<p>For example, many people have watched the supportive &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist Film Series&acirc;&euro; of documentaries, which in one form or another, and when these people walk by YOUR Zeitgeist booth they will feel an instant connection and they will be brought back to the feelings that they initially had when they saw the movies. Your local Zeitgeist chapter booth will take this massive message of worldwide change and place it right in their backyards. This is where real change will happen: in our own backyards.</p>

			<p>Certainly these types of events are pretty generic and will happen in some form or another in most cities around the world. So keep in mind that similar events are duplicated in pretty much any city or town.&nbsp;</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2><a name="types-of-events" id="types-of-events"></a>&nbsp;5.1 - Types of Events</h2>

			<p><strong>Chapter Meetings</strong></p>

			<p>These meetings have a more serious and binding character, with objectives to be fulfilled and decisions to be made. These usually precede major projects and events that the Chapter might initiate. The advantage of these is that they can develop much more work than a simple gathering where much is said but little is done or documented. Usually these meetings occur when a Chapter core exceeds 2 people and is already active.</p>

			<p><strong>Street Events</strong></p>

			<p>When executed properly, these are the most effective. A new Chapter, in particular, can achieve a very effective and quick start by becoming active within their community, by simply &acirc;&euro;&oelig;taking it to the people.&acirc;&euro;</p>

			<p>Setting up for a day in a busy downtown center or park with a good level of foot traffic will give you a full day of activism that, even if done daily, will see quite a different stream of people stop by. Simply set up a table in a high traffic area and you will find that people are often ready and willing to engage you in friendly conversation. Many people are simply &acirc;&euro;&oelig;out&acirc;&euro; for the day or out for a walk. They will love the fact that something of interest is presented to them as they walk by, will stop and read your signs and materials, and will engage you in conversation. This won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t happen any other way. It can be done as often as daily, or more realistically once a week or perhaps once a month. Especially for a new Chapter, the feeling of effectively spreading information to completely new people every time you are out on the street -- people who have not even heard of The Zeitgeist Movement or a Resource Based Economy --
			will be very exciting, and will be a huge factor in a new Chapter getting set up quickly. Further, you will have that immediate success of achieving what made an individual or small group want to start a Chapter in the first place, which is to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;take action&acirc;&euro;! What is more, the cost is minimal or free (beyond your overheads, e,g., table, flyers, DVDs, etc.).</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Another technique (used with astonishing success by the Vancouver chapter) is to set up some A-frame street boards. These stop people in their tracks and are real conversation starters! Many people will stop and read your street boards and then feel more at ease to engage you in conversation. This is much more effective than thrusting a flyer at someone rushing by. Try to have some business cards, flyers or even DVDs available to hand to people that show interest. When in doubt, overstock. It is surprising how quickly you can hand out all of your materials!</p>

			<p>Finding a good location to host your own public event at least once a month, will give you a real foundation for your chapter. Usually a high traffic location in a downtown core or common area is best. Chances are there is already a location in your town or city where you have seen other activist groups. Universities or parks could also offer great areas. <em>NOTE: Check with your town or city laws regarding any restrictions.</em></p>

			<p><strong>Public Exhibitions (Movie Screenings)</strong></p>

			<p>Acquiring a theater or a room with video projection capability is the typical way of setting up a screening. Relevant information and documentaries can be displayed as a way of conveying information, rather than lectures. An example would be to show the movie "Zeitgeist: Moving Forward" to an audience that has not yet seen the film. There is also a series of lectures by The Zeitgeist Movement that can be downloaded for free in DVD format. Of course, Movement media material &nbsp;is &nbsp;not &nbsp;the &nbsp;only &nbsp;kind &nbsp;that &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;displayed. &nbsp;There &nbsp;are &nbsp;other &nbsp;socially &nbsp;relevant documentaries that can be part of a program, for example &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Collapse&acirc;&euro; featuring Michael Ruppert or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Future by Design&acirc;&euro; featuring Jacque Fresco. However, it is essential to keep the focus on The Zeitgeist Movement.</p>

			<p>If an experienced (and confident) member is planning such an event or even just in attendance, it is a good idea to try to also involve the audience in a Q&amp;A session about the Movement after the screening. Since the questions about what the Movement is, what it advocates, common misconceptions, etc., are quite common, this interaction with the public is very important, and because of this, the member who will answer the questions needs to be well prepared. If more than one member is available for the Q&amp;A, it is fine to either divide the questions between yourselves, each provide some comment following each question, or simply use whatever technique you work most comfortably with.</p>

			<p><strong>Lectures</strong></p>

			<p>Lectures are formal presentations made by one or more members to inform the public about a particular &nbsp;subject. &nbsp;These &nbsp;lectures &nbsp;generally &nbsp;contain &nbsp;both &nbsp;a &nbsp;visual &nbsp;and &nbsp;an &nbsp;oral &nbsp;element, i.e., speakers often utilize audiovisual tools, such as a PowerPoint presentation or a movie, to make themselves understood and/or to summarize what is being said. Good examples are older TZM lectures: "Where Are We Now?" and "Where Are We Going?" This format is best used in combination with other formats, since lectures can be a very one-way exchange of information.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Town Hall</strong></p>

			<p>Town &nbsp;Halls &nbsp;are &nbsp;periodic &nbsp;public &nbsp;awareness&nbsp; events &nbsp;conducted &nbsp;by &nbsp;regional &nbsp;or &nbsp;local &nbsp;Chapters, typically run indoors in a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;hall&acirc;&euro; setting, with a seated participatory audience. Ideally these events occur monthly. Unlike &acirc;&euro;&oelig;one-way&acirc;&euro; lectures that perhaps have Q&amp;A at the end only as a wrapup, Town Halls are, by design, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;two-way&acirc;&euro;, being interactive from start to finish (beyond opening remarks and introductions). Based on proven effective standards through historic civil rights movements, the aim is to inform the public of the concepts and goals of the Movement and thus raise both awareness and support.</p>

			<p>Town Hall meetings are, by definition, open to the public with everybody in a town community traditionally invited to attend. For this reason the meetings are always to be advertised well in advance via a Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s website, and any other form of publicity in which the Chapter may wish to engage. People attend Town Hall meetings not necessarily to voice their own opinions, but, at a minimum, to hear the responses to questions from representatives of the Movement.</p>

			<p>There are no specific rules or guidelines for holding a town hall meeting. If the turnout is large, and in a particular case the objective is to give as many people as possible an opportunity to speak, then the group can be broken down into smaller discussion groups. Each group, in that case, appoints someone to summarize discussion of their group. The flexibility of the meeting format allows for either maximum public participation via discussion or for comprehensive Q&amp;A with an informed panel where it is desired.</p>

			<p><strong>Large music festival style concerts</strong></p>

			<p>The bottom line: these are just plain FUN, with typically young and happy attendees numbering into the thousands, and all locked in for a full day (sometimes 2 or 3 days) just wandering around and VERY open to talking about social issues and initiatives such as the Zeitgeist Movement.</p>

			<p>Costs for such events vary. It depends on the length of show, the acts performing, and the size, location and notoriety of the festival. In all cases, as a non-profit making Movement you may find you are eligible for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;non-profit&acirc;&euro; prices when it comes to renting a stall or booth. It may even be possible to negotiate even better rates through taking the time to emphasize the Movement and its tenets, the fact that we are all volunteers, and so on.</p>

			<p>Regarding where you are located within a venue, typically vendors, artists and information booths are set a good distance from stages in order to give the event attendees a break from the music. If given a choice between close to or far from the stage, it is always best to select a location farther back; your vocal cords will thank you for it! Keeping such a distance allows the vendors the relative quiet they need to talk with interested visitors at their booth.</p>

			<p>With regard to what you will need to make the event a success for your Chapter, usually you will need to bring your own &acirc;&euro;&oelig;kit&acirc;&euro;. It is, therefore, highly recommended to have the necessary equipment on standby, that way there are no surprises. It is also important to ensure sure you understand your contract with regard to what is included. For example, many large events will supply the basics, such as a tent or rain cover, a couple of chairs and a table. It is very important to ask questions of the event organizers so that you have all the details well beforehand, and no surprises present themselves on the big day.&nbsp;</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Keep in mind that many of these events -- especially the larger ones -- can be booked up to six months in advance; therefore, leaving your booking to the last minute will probably cause you to lose out. These events fill up fast as they are very popular, and for very good reason; they are fun and offer the kind of mass attendance that makes talking to hundreds of people very easy!&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Local Community Street Festivals</strong></p>

			<p>The cost of these events is typically very low, and may even be free. Usually you need to supply your own tent, table and chairs. Attendance at these types of events can push into the many thousands, depending on your location. For instance, the Car Free Vancouver event draws over 160,000 people across four locations, all on a single day! The 2011 Car Free Festival marked the Vancouver &nbsp;Chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s 4th year at this event and, to quote them, it &acirc;&euro;&oelig;is always a total blast!&acirc;&euro; Other similar annual festivals happen in most large cities. Google &acirc;&euro;&oelig;&lt;your town&gt; festivals&acirc;&euro;; you may be surprised at how many you find!</p>

			<p><strong>Local Film Festivals</strong></p>

			<p>When they happen in your city, these are very worthwhile events as they are based around films that are usually thought-provoking and socially relevant. If set up in advance you might be able to have &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Addendum&acirc;&euro; or &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Moving Forward&acirc;&euro; shown on their program.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>

			<p>A conference is a gathering -- typically sponsored by a corporation or the like -- of focused adults and/or professionals who meet to discuss something of common interest around a given theme, for example, the environment. It can last several days and usually includes multiple meetings, presentations, workshops and exhibitions. Typically, large numbers of attendees visit from afar for these multi-day events. Prices can be quite expensive just for general admission, let alone an exhibitor fee, and thus viable only for special events like Z-Day (see below).&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Zeitgeist Movement Chapters may be involved in conferences in two different ways. It may, firstly, be the case that members from your Chapter are invited to present at a conference held by a similar like-minded organization or coalition of organizations. In this case awareness of the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s aims and ethos, and the RBE model will be achieved with relatively little organization beyond attending the conference and, of course, preparing the presentation. If a Chapter plans to hold a conference themselves, or in collaboration with other Chapters, this is considerably&nbsp;more work, but is a viable option for Chapters with the collective resources to do so. It may also&nbsp;be a highly appealing event that brings in Chapter members from around the country, or even from overseas, as well as members of other organizations or members of the public. Any well-known speakers may prove to be a major drawcard at such events and bring with them a potentially large
			following of people receptive to the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s message. It is certainly worth maintaining &nbsp;a &nbsp;professional &nbsp;and &nbsp;collaborative relationship &nbsp;with &nbsp;other &nbsp;organizations &nbsp;as &nbsp;the potential of such events to result in a good level of ongoing interest in the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s aims is very high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Annual Z-Day</strong></p>

			<p>This is the original annual awareness event of the Movement, intended to be intellectual and educational in its approach. The hosting city for the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;main&acirc;&euro; global event varies (New York City in&nbsp;2009 and 2010, London in 2011, Vancouver in 2012), it is held in the mid-March time period, and local Chapters are invited to participate in remote parallel fashion. As your local Chapter grows it is important to continue to build on this annual event. Your event should include a number of activities and/or a combination of several types of events, such as street action, screenings, lectures, and Q&amp;A. For more information and to register your local event, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://zdayglobal.org/">http://zdayglobal.org/</a>. Many Chapters are likely to start with smaller events such as screenings with Q&amp;A, building up to larger events such as, perhaps, full-day conferences, as the Chapter develops in resources and
			capacity.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Annual Zeitgeist Media Festival</strong></p>

			<p>As the newest Zeitgeist event added to the list of annual global events, this is one you do not want your chapter &nbsp;to &nbsp;miss &nbsp;out &nbsp;on! &nbsp;It &nbsp;is &nbsp;artistic &nbsp;and &nbsp;celebratory &nbsp;in &nbsp;nature,&nbsp; and &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;great opportunity to offer a fun day of music, arts and information to the general public in an open festival format. Similar to Z-Day (but in the Northern hemisphere&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Summer months), there is a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;main event&acirc;&euro; hosting city (LA in 2011), and local chapters are invited to participate in parallel fashion. For more information and to register your local event, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://zeitgeistmediafestival.org/">http://zeitgeistmediafestival.org/</a>.</p>

			<h2><a name="finding-a-space" id="finding-a-space"></a>5.2 - Finding a Space&nbsp;</h2>

			<p>In most cases, a theater or a hall will be enough for your event. If you live in a big city, there should be numerous spaces available, usually in the form of a lecture theater or concert hall. If you live in a smaller city, often the premises of a church, theater, library, or any other public building can also be used. It is always good to book well in&nbsp; advance and ensure that any necessary audio/visual media materials are also provided through a rental agency or the like, if the Chapter or venue does not have immediate access to them.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>Due &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;somewhat &nbsp;controversial &nbsp;nature &nbsp;of &nbsp;what &nbsp;the &nbsp;Movement &nbsp;advocates, &nbsp;lack &nbsp;of&nbsp;comprehension and/or fear from people/organizations is not uncommon. Because of this, communication is crucial. Instead of trying to describe in detail what the Movement is about, it is advisable to focus on just the basics, stated in a generic way: that we are an organization that advocates sustainability to help society shift to a more ecologically and socially sustainable way of living. If the conversation is kept somewhat soft and ambiguous along these lines, the chances of disagreement will be decreased.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2><a name="gathering-materials" id="gathering-materials"></a>5.3 - Gathering Materials&nbsp;</h2>

			<p>Obviously, money comes into play when it comes to acquiring materials. Here are some basic tips on how to acquire resources, taking into account what the Movement stands for.</p>

			<div>
				<strong>Do not ask for money, ask for resources</strong>
			</div>

			<div>
				An important thing to consider when you are working in a team is providing necessary materials together. Instead of setting a budget, think about how to provide resources for the event. For example, if you need a place to run the event, ask your community if someone could provide it for free or for a small monetary compensation. Agree to bring food and beverages instead of buying them before or selling them during the event. There are many ways to work together, and in some cases it is amazing how everyone can contribute with something to the event without spending a lot.&nbsp;
			</div><br />

			<div>
				<strong>Be very transparent</strong>
			</div>

			<div>
				In some cases, the previous situation may not work as well as expected. If you are in need of a monetary budget, try the following: always calculate the cost beforehand, and set it as your goal for contributions by the community or team.
			</div>

			<p>If you are receiving cash directly, keep a record of who contributed what. Reimburse any funds which turned out not to be needed. If the contribution is provided via the Internet, use a "chip in" widget where everyone can see both the goal and amount collected. Be as transparent as possible when indicating all expenses.</p>

			<div>
				<strong>Funding through government funds/grants for culture or other</strong>
			</div>

			<div>
				Why not use the system to do something good? Since you are already paying taxes and contributing to funding pools, such as education and culture (in many, although not all, countries) and other government resources, you can apply for funding or a grant. If you put together a good plan and submit it to the local organization that deals with the financing of educational and cultural events, there is the possibility of being sponsored. In this case, you must be fully transparent. It is also important to prepare your submission well in advance as many grants take several months to process. <em>NOTE- To get grant money in the U.S. you may need to set up a non-profit organization (NPO) with 501(c) status, which is tedious, time-consuming, and may require the use of an expert attorney on a regular basis just to run it! This model may well apply to other countries - you may need to do some checking around.</em>
			</div>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<div>
				<strong>Sponsorship and cooperation with like-minded organizations</strong>
			</div>

			<div>
				Contact local organizations or corporations that are developing technologies or promoting social directions that are consistent with TZM goals. If you explain the purpose of the Movement, and of an event in particular, they might be interested in sponsoring or participating in the event. You can also offer them a station to present their products/technologies. However you should make it clear that the event does not focus on promoting a commercial product or on selling anything.&nbsp;
			</div>

			<h2><a name="promoting-the-event" id="promoting-the-event"></a>5.4 - Promoting the Event&nbsp;</h2>

			<p>There are many ways to carry out the promotion of your event. Try to be as creative as possible and ask your community/team about any opportunity they might have to get free promotional tools and/or materials.</p>

			<p><strong>Social Networking</strong></p>

			<p>Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, MySpace, or other popular virtual spaces in your region, can be used to promote your event in the most far-reaching way possible without turning yourself into a spammer. Use it to the maximum, but with discretion, and always respect the virtual environment that you are using. This option should be considered essential.</p>

			<p><strong>Word of Mouth</strong></p>

			<p>It is said that word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising, as people trust their friends far more than a soulless advertisement, for example. Furthermore, it is free. Ask your friends and the community to spread the word about the event to their friends, who, in turn, pass it on, etc. Combine this with the power of social networks and you can get decent results. This option should be considered essential.</p>

			<p><strong>Online Classifieds</strong></p>

			<p>In this regard, originally in the U.S. but now going global, nothing is more effective than sites such as Craigslist or Gumtree, which are known to get results, are free, and have sub-websites for just about every major city worldwide. Various countries have their own equivalents which may be more widely used. Consider publishing your advertisement a week or two before the event and then refreshing it a day or two before. When it comes to ticketing for your event <a target="_blank" href="http://eventbrite.com/">http://eventbrite.com/</a> provides a service to both supply tickets (free service for free tickets; service charge for paid tickets) for your event and advertise it, while enabling you to gauge the general level of interest.&nbsp;</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Local newspapers (print or online)</strong></p>

			<p>This can be considered the old fashioned way to advertise, but can still be effective. Of course Chapters should try to get the cheapest adspace possible. Your best bet is a socially conscious newspaper with decent local circulation. On a related note, getting advertisements into public transportation is also quite efficient.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Press Release</strong></p>

			<p>A press release is a written communication directed at members of the news media for the purpose of announcing something ostensibly newsworthy, such as your event! Typically, they are e-mailed to assignment editors at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television stations, and/or television networks. Now, one might think that this is an expensive proposition, but there exists a whole cottage industry of affordable press release publishing websites, and many of them offer their basic service for free or at a minimal cost, for example pr.com. There are sites that will then push this press release out to many more online news feeds, sparing you the labor of this tedious task, again for a nominal cost, for example pressreleasepoint.com.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>The Zeitgeist Movement means</strong> <em>(calendar, news and/or mailing lists)</em></p>

			<p>The Zeitgeist Movement website allows you to use various tools to advertise events to registered members and &nbsp;site &nbsp;visitors. As far as a national &nbsp;Chapter's&nbsp; website &nbsp;goes,&nbsp; the &nbsp;event &nbsp;can &nbsp;be advertised on the calendar, posted in the news section, and also sent via newsletter. The same probably goes for your local chapter website, if it has been developed with these basic features included. This option should be considered essential, especially your Chapter website.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Universities and other educational institutions</strong></p>

			<p>Another very important audience is students. Students tend to be generally quite receptive to skeptical information about the current &acirc;&euro;&oelig;system,&acirc;&euro; and may find it interesting to participate in your event. Be sure to communicate to universities within a reasonable time-frame before the event and see if they are willing to allow you to distribute promotional material for your event on campus. Otherwise, you can ask permission from the student council to post some posters in the appropriate designated areas, and you can also distribute flyers in front of the universities.</p>

			<p><strong>Street Actions</strong></p>

			<p>Engaging in street actions leading up to an event like a lecture or a screening can be effective. With the typical activism set-up of an information booth or stall with some A-frame posters placed around, you can quickly get some interested people to come in, have a quick chat, and leave with your event flyer in hand.</p>

			<p><strong>Local Media</strong></p>

			<p>The local media can be a great way to promote your event. Write a personal letter to ALL&nbsp;institutions involved in reporting local events and do not forget the independent media. If you&nbsp;succeed in getting them to write an article about you, this will help greatly in spreading the word,&nbsp;as well as getting interested people to come to your event.&nbsp;</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Materials for promotion&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Business Cards</strong></p>

			<p>These are effective and cheap for quickly and readily handing out (or leaving behind) your contact information and/or website address. The usual size is around 85x55mm. Websites like <a target="_blank" href="http://vistaprint.com/">vistaprint.com</a> offer very good deals on bulk order business cards. <em>NOTE: Always have some cards on you ready to go!</em></p>

			<p><strong>Flyers</strong></p>

			<p>These are good because they contain relevant event information and other details as well as contacts, and are fairly cheap to make. The size is dependent on the information you want to have, however DL size (100x210mm or 3.9x8.3&acirc;&euro;) or US standard A4 size (8.5x11&acirc;&euro;) is frequently used. You can also go for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;3-fold&acirc;&euro; flyers; these are better for larger quantities of text and are best used in lectures when people are waiting for the speaker, or for takeaways afterward. They may also contain a notice for a future event, thus presenting an effective way to promote.</p>

			<p>Distributing flyers on the street without any direct contact with people, or any explanation is not advised at all. In these situations the flyer usually ends up in the trash without getting any attention whatsoever from the person who received it. The best way is to have people come to you and pick them up because of their own interest.</p>

			<p><strong>DVDs</strong></p>

			<p>DVDs ostensibly contain, for example, one or more of Peter Joseph&acirc;&euro;&trade;s full length films (Zeitgeist, Addendum, or Moving Forward), and/or one or more of his many lectures to date. They are typically handed out during an event, not in promotion of one. See the Appendix for more information and tips on DVDs.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Posters</strong></p>

			<p>Posters can come in all sizes. The A3 size (297x420mm or 11.7x16.5&acirc;&euro;) is recommended for being cheap to produce and yet big enough to be noticed. The bigger the poster the more visible it is; however, the higher the cost is as well.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Street Boards</strong></p>

			<p>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Street Boards&acirc;&euro; are a larger variation of posters. These are large prints like A1 (594x841mm or 23.4x33.1&acirc;&euro;) set on one or both sides of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;A&acirc;&euro; shape platforms, which sit right on the street or, optionally, on a table. An alternative to the A-frame approach is to simply attach a street board print to a flat panel, such as a section of thin plywood, or lightweight (pink) rigid foam insulation panel, and hang it.</p>

			<p>If printed on paper, laminating these street board prints serves to weatherproof them and make&nbsp;them&nbsp; &nbsp;more&nbsp; &nbsp;durable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Alternatively,&nbsp; &nbsp;consider&nbsp; &nbsp;printing&nbsp;&nbsp; your&nbsp; &nbsp;image&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; &nbsp;vinyl.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&nbsp; &nbsp;again, <a target="_blank" href="http://vistaprint.com/">vistaprint.com</a> offers very reasonable prices on these (although they are called Vertical Banners).</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Banners</strong></p>

			<p>A &nbsp;large &nbsp;vinyl &nbsp;banner,&nbsp; also &nbsp;known&nbsp; as &nbsp;a &nbsp;highway &nbsp;banner &nbsp;(approximately &nbsp;3&acirc;&euro;&trade;x15&acirc;&euro;&trade;), &nbsp;is &nbsp;relatively expensive but can also be very durable if handled well. They are great as a background banner with a logo and website for your street stalls, or at the entrance of a venue.</p>

			<p>The most important thing is for you and all participants to enjoy and learn from each other, while also engaging your audience in a positive and educational manner. Here are some small tips and recommendations for your event to flow as smoothly as possible:</p>

			<p><strong>Have some support material available</strong></p>

			<p>In a TZM event there should be an adequate amount of business cards, flyers and/or DVDs to distribute to your visitors, with the intention that they assimilate more information later, in their own time.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Collect media material</strong></p>

			<p>Whenever and wherever possible, film and photograph the events so they can be released, showing others what the Movement does and encouraging further participation.</p>

			<p><strong>Members</strong></p>

			<p>It is very important that the members who are present have good communication skills in order to share the ideas advocated by the Movement.</p>

			<p><strong>Scheduling and Flexibility</strong></p>

			<p>Arrive &nbsp;extra &nbsp;early &nbsp;on &nbsp;the&nbsp; first &nbsp;day, &nbsp;in &nbsp;order &nbsp;to &nbsp;leave &nbsp;plenty &nbsp;of &nbsp;time &nbsp;for &nbsp;any &nbsp;last &nbsp;minute preparations. Be prompt thereafter; visitors may arrive early and if they do not see anyone, they might leave.</p>

			<p>Once up and running, during event hours, while there is no need to set a strict schedule, it is imperative that the stall or booth is manned at all times by at least one member, if for no reason other than security. Aside from this you can informally agree how the booth will be run. For example, if three members are present, perhaps two can attend the booth and the third can take a walk about around the venue handing out flyers.</p>

			<p>Give yourself enough free time during the day for meals and bio-breaks, etc., with some kind of&nbsp;rotation scheme. After all, it is a matter of gaining experience and exchanging information, not a test of time-management or endurance.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Ensure the event site is appealing</strong></p>

			<p>Ensure you have, and maintain, a friendly, welcoming, clean and stimulating environment in which to exchange knowledge. We want visitors to feel welcome, not annoyed or scared of approaching.</p>

			<p><strong>Ensure the integrity of all information</strong></p>

			<p>Ensure the Movement information being delivered by you and your team members is accurate and reliable, and that it is being properly communicated to your visitors. Make sure that all visitors understand that the Movement is more interested in solutions than in problems.</p>

			<p><strong>Food &amp; Beverage</strong></p>

			<p>As the Movement always advocates the use of personal resources over feeding the monetary system, free-sharing is an option that serves well for the provision of food and beverages at events while, at the same time, discouraging unnecessary commercialism. Assuming it is allowed by the venue, consider bringing your own food and drinks for the event, and, where possible, encouraging attendees to do likewise. The free-sharing option, aside from most likely being cheaper than the food sold by other stalls at the event, can lead to pleasant interactions and a breakdown of barriers, contributing, in part, to the process of cultural mindset shift.</p>

			<p>One exception to this recommended alternative to monetary exchange is situations in which &nbsp;it is necessary to generate a small profit from the sale of food and drink in order to pay for the event.</p>

			<p><strong>Take Notes about the Event at the end</strong></p>

			<p>Upon its conclusion, consider jotting down notes of what went right and what went wrong during the event; a basic archive log. Based upon this, consider what might be improved next time and share it with other active members so they can also learn from your experiences and insights.</p>
