		<h2><a name="street-activism" id="street-activism"></a>8.2 - Street Activism</h2><br />

		<div>
			Street activism itself should be as objective, calm and friendly as possible, and the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s message should be conveyed with integrity and clarity. For example, one could seek to convey the information and describe concepts such as cyclical consumption, the scientific method, RBEM, etc.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In general, always cooperate with the police. Their stigma aside, they are there to protect you. If you chat with them in a friendly way some of them may even have heard of, and/or advocate for, the Movement.
		</div><br />

		<h2><a name="protests" id="protests"></a>8.3 - Protests</h2><br />

		<div>
			The Zeitgeist Movement is a social/educational movement and it does not engage in any protest or demonstration as a means to convey the central message. This is simply inefficient and does not address the root problem. In &nbsp;order words, it can be noble but does not go far enough. Thus,&nbsp;as emotional and exciting as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;high energy&acirc;&euro; protest actions may seem, they should not be carried out <em>on behalf of</em> The Zeitgeist Movement.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			That said, the Movement is encouraged to be present at peaceful and socially relevant protests. The conduct displayed by members representing the Movement must be of an informative and educational posture, not one of protest or sarcasm. A suggested strategy is to set up information stalls in peripheral areas, at a safe distance from the central protest action. This can be supported by a mobile team of activists that roam the area and calmly approach people, talk to them, hand out flyers, etc.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			If someone who happens to be a Movement member chooses to join in the protest in and of itself, as an individual in their own right, they should make sure they are not identified as a Movement activist, and be aware that they may not be representing the Movement at that time. Specifically, one should avoid using promotional material of the Movement such as t-shirts, posters, banners, etc. Neither should one make reference to the national/global structure, and never communicate in the first person plural <em>"we&acirc;&euro;</em>.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In the event of physical violence, any Movement activist should get away from the scene and should also avoid participating in any verbal violence towards any particular group.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<h2><a name="fundraising" id="fundraising"></a>8.4 - Fundraising</h2><br />

		<div>
			As a global rule, the Movement operates on the basis of time dedication and not monetary dedication. No chapter is allowed to solicit direct, open donations. The phrase &acirc;&euro;&oelig;open donations&acirc;&euro; refers to ongoing donations gathered without explicit purpose for the money raised. For example, donations gathered to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;support the Movement&acirc;&euro;, is too vague and open-ended, and affords no transparency. However, a process of gathering donations on the basis of meeting a particular need during a particular time-period with the express purpose of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;hiring a venue&acirc;&euro; for an upcoming event, for example, allows people to fully understand where their money is going, and this transparency, therefore, facilitates their informed decision regarding whether or not to donate.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Overall, The Movement deliberately operates on a personal contribution, volunteer model. However, there are two basic exceptions to the restriction on monetary transactions. Since the websites cost money to run, simple merchandise is respectable to offer. The Global Website, for example, offers a single shirt to help offset the administrative and hosting costs. Each Chapter is allowed to also offer a custom shirt or similar. However, any "excessive" merchandising will be shut down if it presents a case for abuse. Such decisions are made by international/global admin consensus.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The second exception is when a specific temporal project is required which needs funding. Typically, it is expected that such funding will come personally from an individual or set of individuals working with the Chapter directly. In the event that this cannot happen, a fully transparent temporary donation system can be put into place to meet the needs of that project.
