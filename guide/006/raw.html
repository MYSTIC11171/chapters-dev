		<h2><a name="your-idea" id="your-idea"></a>6.1 - &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Your idea, your project&acirc;&euro; concept</h2>

		<p>The Zeitgeist Movement is a movement based on volunteer efforts by members; most of these volunteers have to deal with their own busy lives, which naturally include studying, working, family, friends, etc. There is no one in the Movement who is providing a full-time service or being paid to do so; even the most stressful responsibilities are being sustained by the sheer effort of the people who volunteer to fulfil them.</p>

		<p>If you have an idea for a project in the Movement, then you automatically position yourself to become the person responsible for it, rather than the Chapter coordinators or other project managers. Of course, you are free to state that you cannot organize it or you don't have the time; however, you have to be aware that it is very unlikely that someone else will develop it, and emotional reactions about this won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t lead you anywhere.</p>

		<p>The reason such an obvious point is being stated here is because there has been an unfortunate tendency for some members to assume they can dump all of the hard work they propose on the already stressed-out coordinators, claiming that they should do it because it is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;their job.&acirc;&euro; Naturally this was never the case, and this is nothing more than an unfortunate lack of understanding of how the Movement operates.</p>

		<p>To reiterate a recurring theme of this document, most coordinators do what they do because they perceive a need or a gap, or had an idea and worked towards it from their own initiative by stepping up to do it. As a member of a Movement based on voluntary contributions, you are no different. To wit: your idea, your project.</p><br />

		<h2><a name="guidlines" id="guidlines"></a>6.2 - Guidelines</h2>

		<p>Good managers and coordinators are the key to large-scale community organizing. They do not tell other people what to do, but help others to take charge of what is needed. They do not grab center-stage, but nudge others onto the stage. They are not interested in being &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The Leader&acirc;&euro;, but in trying to help people become their own leaders. They recognize that only by creating "more leaders" can an organizing effort expand.</p>

		<p>For the sake of simplicity, a leader can be defined as a proactive member instead of a reactive or passive one.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>Create an example</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The best way for a leader to show what they mean, and to make sure others have an accurate reference point, is to create an example. Human beings are known to learn a lot from imitating one others&acirc;&euro;&trade; conduct or actions. For more elaborate projects, a proposal document that clearly articulates your idea also helps others to visualize it. A basic proposal template is provided in a later section.
		</div>

		<p>This way you reduce the chance of having two people thinking they are working on the same thing when, in reality, they are not.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>Divide up and delegate work</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Divide tasks or projects into bite-size chunks, then discuss each chunk and agree upon who will take it on. Make sure everyone has the ability to carry out their task, then let them carry it out in their own way. It is important to have someone check on progress; people do not feel good about doing a job if nobody seems to care about whether it gets done.
		</div>

		<p>Failure in this area (of dividing and clearly delegating) will most likely lead to disappointment or worse, mainly due to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;diffusion of responsibility&acirc;&euro; effect.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>Appreciate all contributions, no matter how small</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Recognize people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s efforts in conversations, at meetings, in newsletters, etc., and thank them accordingly. Although in a true egalitarian sense no one should feel the need to either deliver or receive thanks because we are all working as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;one big team&acirc;&euro;, so to speak, showing gratitude and appreciation is natural, and is helpful in providing a little ego and confidence boost to the recipient.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Welcome constructive criticism</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Accepting criticism may be difficult for some, but members need to feel they can be critical without being attacked. Do not confuse constructive criticism on a given issue with personal attacks.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Help people to believe in themselves</strong>
		</div>

		<p>A good manager/leader builds people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s confidence so that they can accomplish what they have never accomplished before. The unflagging optimism of a manager energizes everyone.</p>

		<p>It is vital to inspire trust as people are unlikely to help those they do not trust. Always maintain the highest standards of honesty. Good managers have no difficulty in airing doubts about their own personal limitations.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>Remind people of a higher purpose</strong>
		</div>

		<p>People often volunteer to serve some higher purpose. If you want to start, or organize, something, you should be able to articulate this purpose, to hold it up as a glowing beacon&nbsp;whenever the occasion demands.</p>

		<p>Whenever something positive is achieved, celebrate it as an example of what can happen when people work together for a common good; it helps the group to feel good about their efforts.</p>

		<p>In order to enhance this &acirc;&euro;&oelig;articulation in front of others&acirc;&euro; and build confidence in yourself going forward, consider pursuing training in public speaking (for example Toastmasters International). <em>Note that this is not a requisite but a bonus feature.</em></p>

		<div>
			<strong>Avoid doing most of the work</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t try to run the whole show or do most of the work. Others will become less involved, and you will burn out.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Be informed and inform</strong>
		</div>

		<p>Keep yourself and others informed. Once there is a development in a project, this update should be transmitted to all pertinent team members, especially those who are counting on you for something, within a suitable time-frame. Simultaneously, the simple act of making weekly or biweekly reports, depending on the level of activity of the project, can be crucial to keeping it on track towards success, not only for the project in question, but also for others who depend directly or indirectly on it.</p>

		<p>Basically, the simple act of keeping everything as updated, and everyone as informed as possible, facilitates a more dynamic and motivating work environment for all involved. It also adds to members&acirc;&euro;&trade; sense that they are valued when they are kept informed and asked for updates on their own progress.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>Keep Focused</strong>
		</div>

		<p>Some skills are useful for the success of a certain project or purpose, and there are others that are essential; concentration, or focus, is one of these essential skills.</p>

		<p>The ability or discipline of concentration in the execution of a task is very powerful. One of the worst mistakes that can be made in this regard is to overload a volunteer. Piling on too many projects at the same time only serves to diffuse their concentration or focus; this, in turn, could trigger a loss in momentum, or even worse, the loss of the member. It is prudent to check, on occasion, that active members are not feeling overloaded or overwhelmed. If you find out that they are then it is important to take steps to provide support and correct the balance, or consider assigning the task to someone else.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>Be Patient</strong>
		</div>

		<p>This point simply cannot be stressed enough. Refer back to the Getting Real with Expectations part of the Basics section above. You cannot demand top-level dedication or performance from someone who is volunteering with their free time.</p>

		<p>Losing patience only makes things worse to you and to others: patience is not just a virtue, it is a necessity.</p><br />

		<h2><a name="project-methodology" id="project-methodology"></a>6.3 - Project Methodology</h2>

		<p>A project is defined as comprising the following features: it is contemplated with a goal or outcome in mind, devised or planned strategically, then executed, either within a specified timeframe, or treated as ongoing.</p>

		<p>Project management is defined as the discipline of planning, organizing and managing resources to bring about the successful completion of specific project goals and objectives.</p>

		<p>The Project Methodology is comprised of 8 simple phases which must be accomplished in their respective order to ensure the eventual success and maximization of the project's objectives.</p>

		<div>
			These &acirc;&euro;&oelig;phases&acirc;&euro; are similar to the Scientific Method:
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 1</strong> &ndash; Identify new problem/adopt new idea
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 2</strong> &ndash; Research
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 3</strong> &ndash; Planning
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 4</strong> &ndash; Resource calculation and acquisition (including human resources)
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 5</strong> &ndash; Delegate tasks, then set target milestones and/or deadlines against them
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 6</strong> &ndash; Put into action, then periodically check up on the task progress and address/solve any problems encountered (depending on the problem severity you may need to return to phase 2/3)
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 7</strong> &ndash; Review overall project progress (If the project goals are not being completed in timely fashion you may need to return to phase 2/3)
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Phase 8</strong> &ndash; Finalizing/archiving.
		</div><br />

		<h2><a name="devising-a-project" id="devising-a-project"></a>6.4 - Devising a Project Structure</h2>

		<div>
			<strong>Stating the objective and rationale</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			To assure clarity of a given project in terms of stated goals and processes there is an established and recommended proposal template, the minimum requirements of which are as follows:
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Name of project:</strong> A consistent name is required.
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Member(s) responsible:</strong> To inform who is/are the manager/s of the project. Contact details should also be included.
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Objective:</strong> What is/are the intended outcome/s of the project?
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Rationale:</strong> What are the reasons highlighting the need for such a project?&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Description:</strong> What is the general plan or process of development of the project in order to achieve the desired objectives?
		</div>

		<p>The project document should attempt to describe the fundamental attributes: <em>What? Who? Where? When? Why? How?</em></p>

		<p>Having your objective and rationale clearly stated will help bring more volunteers on board, ensure that they will understand it, and make them more proactive.</p>

		<p><strong>Emphasis on Planning</strong> <em>(phase 3)</em></p>

		<p>Planning (tasks, functions, workflows) is a process often underestimated when approaching a project. However, this is absolutely crucial, if not the most crucial step in a project, since the act of planning plays a large part in determining the future success of the project.</p>

		<p>A common saying in time management is that <em>"Every minute in planning saves 10 minutes in the implementation/action."</em> The realization of a solid plan, with clarity and vision, is half of the success of a project.</p>

		<div>
			The keys to a successful plan can be summarized as:
		</div>

		<div>
			(1) Define tasks and/or components
		</div>

		<div>
			(2) Define the specific objective(s) of different tasks
		</div>

		<div>
			(3) Set priorities
		</div>

		<div>
			(4) Calculate resources required
		</div>

		<p>The plan should be as clear and simple as possible so that anyone, for example a new volunteer, can understand it.</p><br />

		<h2><a name="organizing-volunteers" id="organizing-volunteers"></a>6.5 - Organizing Volunteers</h2>

		<div>
			With a document describing the project and some organizational details, the next step is to get volunteers to produce positive results. While some different techniques may be used depending on the context, a very basic process is as follows:
		</div>

		<div>
			1. Schedule a meeting in which interested members can discuss the project and make suggestions, fill in details, and address other important issues that pertain to the project.
		</div>

		<div>
			2. Make sure some specific roles and/or tasks are assigned to specific volunteers.
		</div>

		<div>
			3. Over time, keep track of the work being done, send reminders if necessary, and, if warranted, talk with each volunteer individually to make sure he/she understands their task at hand. If any uncertainty exists, have them describe their task to you as a check.
		</div>
