1.3. Getting Real with Expectations

As a volunteer movement, activist participation comes from people who derive satisfaction from contributing their time, skills and personal resources toward furthering the Movement’s direction. If an individual is not deriving some sort of satisfaction from their participation, then they will quickly burn out and move on in search of something else that is more satisfying. The level of disappointment or satisfaction an activist experiences is largely impacted by their internal comparison of what actually occurs with their preconceived expectations. It is, therefore, important to become self-aware of any personal expectations concerning three areas in particular that may require adjustments that allow for greater margin of satisfaction. The three areas are: what you expect for a transition to a Resource-Based Economic Model (RBEM), what you expect for the Zeitgeist Movement as a whole, and what you expect in your role as a chapter coordinator.
What to Expect for a Transition to an RBEM

The Movement acknowledges that in order for a new sustainable system to be both created and maintained globally, we, as a civilization, need to have both an understanding of the new set of values required to sustain it and a genuine desire to participate in it. This understanding and desire needs to be cultivated by creating critical mass awareness -- essentially a global paradigm shift -- which is the biggest task in bringing an RBE model into existence. We are doing our best to create this paradigm shift by introducing others to these ideas and educating them about the benefits that come with an RBEM as compared with our current monetary system. While we, of course, desire this to happen as soon as possible, and believe the more we step up our activism efforts the better the chances are for accelerating our progress, one quickly finds this enthusiasm is tested daily against the barriers of cultivated ignorance and superstitions perpetuated by the current zeitgeist. There are also larger factors largely beyond our control: the depletion and exploitation of natural resources, natural disasters, wars and other conflicts around the world, government and media controls, etc. Thus it is possible that an RBEM is outside the scope of what will occur in one’s lifetime. People who thrive as activists for the long haul are those who see value in simply participating in creating the possibility of an RBEM at some point in the future. In other words, there is a pleasure reward derived from the act of raising awareness that is not dependent upon an immediate outcome or direct benefit. In order to see the changes we wish for we must enact them, as urged by Gandhi, “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”, regardless of whether we live to see such changes personally or not. Any voluteers acting in immediate self-interest are likely to rapidly become disappointed with the pace of change.

What to Expect of the Movement

We all come from different experiences with non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations, political organizations, corporations, community groups, perhaps a combination of these, or perhaps none of them. Because of this, people bring all sorts of expectations based on what they have participated in in the past. Some of these expectations are workable within our model and others are not. It helps to understand first how our structure differs from other entities. First of all, we are not an entity that occupies a particular physical space. We have no offices or classrooms specifically designated for our work. Essentially, the entire world is both our classroom and our office. We are global and without boundaries. The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) is not any formal entity by the definition of any government. TZM refers to the hundreds of thousands of activist volunteers worldwide that actively support raising awareness about the Movement’s direction, and participate in the existing global communication structure in some way while doing this. The Movement is predefined as an educational effort created by a network of volunteers advocating a move away from a monetary economic system and into an RBE using science and technology for the sustainable management of the earth’s resources. Outside of this, we have adopted a model most similar to the Civil Rights Movement and our non-violent approach to creating change has been inspired by figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Both of these individuals are famously known for their non-violent resistance methods to gain attention and to create opportunities to educate others about new possibilities in order to facilitate a cultural change in values that support positive change.

Expectations of chapter activity within the Movement should take into account the nature of work done on a voluntary basis by intrinsically motivated individuals who are adding the work to their already busy schedules. If, at any time, a person is unable to contribute their time and work due to family, health, relocation, job or other personal matters, it is expected that they may choose to discontinue, or at least, pause their volunteer work. The expectations of a coordinator, therefore, need to allow for varied cycles of productivity that reflect a continuous rotation of new volunteers stepping in and some experienced volunteers stepping out on an ongoing basis. For this reason we try to automate and standardize as much as possible in our communications so that we can easily retain momentum with new volunteers. Despite attempts to facilitate ease of chapter functioning, a certain level of both patience and creative problem-solving are required when working within the limitations of volunteers and resources.

What to Expect as a Chapter Coordinator

The ideas of this Movement appear self-evident and, as a result, supporters who volunteer to become Chapter coordinators may expect other people to be equally enthusiastic and supportive through action once they become exposed and oriented to the information. Unfortunately, finding volunteers with the same level of acceptance and understanding, having available discretionary time to contribute, and who are actually willing to devote their spare time to this direction, is not so easy. Instead of being frustrated by this state of affairs it helps to understand that this is not due to any shortcomings in those you are dealing with, but, instead, due to the deliberate social design of the Zeitgeist itself, which is to say that most of us are coerced or pressured to live in a form of distressed and distracted wage slavery. As our current socio-economic system continues to break down, people are concerned with their own survival: making ends meet, being able to feed their families, and taking care of basic needs. In addition, many people have endured a lifetime of conditioning to be a worker and consumer, allowing others to make their decisions for them instead of adopting self-directed education practices and questioning established institutions. It is also the case that some cultural differences in geographical regions are better poised to be open to learning new, progressive information than other cultures/regions, perhaps due to higher average levels of social awareness or simply more available time to devote to the process. With these understandings, it is important not to become discouraged if you feel like it is taking a while for other volunteers to step up to assist you in planning and executing awareness-raising events and activities. Every chapter once started with at least one person making some kind of effort to share this knowledge with others in some way.  Some chapters had only one person spreading information for up to a year before they had others step up to assist and the chapter began growing. The important thing is that you are making an effort to inform people of where they can find out about solutions to the problems they perceive if they are interested. You are sowing seeds that may take a while to grow. Coordinators who are self-directed, self-motivated and derive pleasure from simply starting new conversations where they are and enjoy meeting new people tend to fare best over time in getting something started.

Sometimes it is tempting to want to replicate all the larger events that other chapters are doing because you desire that type of event for your community. However, it is important to know your limits and to plan events on a scale relative to the actual level of interest where you are. A suggested path is to start out with small events in the street, cafes, public libraries or community centres. Then, as the chapter grows and more skilled volunteers step forward, it will become possible to begin planning for events with a larger reach. It is helpful to recognize that it is better to plan for an event with 30 seats and end up turning some people away due to being over-capacity than it is to put massive energy and resources into renting a 500-seat, high-tech venue for an event that only 20 people attend. It is safest to plan so that the resources match the level of interest in the community to the best of your chapter’s ability and then, even if you have to turn people away, this can simply be responded to as feedback for the next event to be slightly larger or to hold the same event again on another day to accommodate more people. Many people begin only virtually, by holding regular online meetings in a Teamspeak channel before meeting in person. However, it is important that, even in the beginning stages, individuals feel comfortable doing face-to-face streets-based or community activism or small meet-ups to begin to connect with people within your community at ground level.
