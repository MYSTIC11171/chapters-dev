		<div>
			The purpose of this guide is to assist and facilitate the creation and development of any kind of Chapter within <em>The Zeitgeist Movement</em>. Topics include, but are not limited to: organizing a core group; organizing local events and projects; setting up communication mediums; how to deal with &acirc;&euro;&oelig;noise&acirc;&euro; in the chapter, etc.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Before reading this document and creating a chapter, it is highly recommended to read or view the <em>Zeitgeist Movement Orientation Guide</em> (found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com">www.thezeitgeistmovement.com</a>) in order to comprehend the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s overall aims and ethos, and understandings around the global Resource-Based Economic Model (RBEM) it advocates.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			A core logical conclusion of the Movement, as derived from empirical evidence pertaining to economic and environmental sustainability, and sociocultural issues, is that, in order to move toward a sustainable, peaceful and happy future on this planet, the monetary system must be replaced. This is due to it being inherently and irredeemably flawed as well as being responsible, either directly or indirectly, for a large proportion of destruction in the world. It is in the key focus area of educating the world that the millennia-old monetary system is now obsolete that the Zeitgeist Movement is, indeed, standing on the doorstep of history. The manifestation of the Movement at the local community level -- its most visible focal point to the populous -- is the global network of local chapters worldwide. Therefore, by starting and building a local chapter in accordance with the tenets and understandings of the Movement, you are personally adding to this unfolding history in a very
			positive way.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			As in most documents, within this one there is the necessary use of very basic but potentially polarizing terms such as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;we,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;us,&acirc;&euro; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;they,&acirc;&euro; them,&acirc;&euro; and their derivatives, within the context of larger phrases. Although such phrasing is natural for drawing distinctions and lends itself to properly conveying the subject material, it is critical to understand that there is truly no &acirc;&euro;&oelig;us versus them&acirc;&euro; within the Zeitgeist Movement. It is all &acirc;&euro;&oelig;us&acirc;&euro;, globally, as we are all, in the end, one people sharing this single fragile planet. This needs to be your mindset as you apply yourself to activism with the Movement.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Unlike most movements and organizations today that operate according to a hierarchical system, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;our&acirc;&euro;</em> purpose takes shape around a shared set of understandings, which is the body of ideas that <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;we&acirc;&euro;</em> have collectively agreed to support, and hope that others eventually do too. This allows the Movement to be leaderless and holographic in nature, operating on a basis of voluntary contribution and consensus. Both the concept and role of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;leader&acirc;&euro; become redundant when groups share responsibility for completing tasks, making decisions, and achieving outcomes.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Thus, regardless of the path of education and awareness that got them to this point, <em>any</em> person who becomes consciously aware of, and advocates for, the aims and ethos of the Movement, becomes an immediate representative of the Movement at any point they choose to become one. From here it is only a small step further to spread awareness, start a Chapter, and contribute to the Movement. It is naturally encouraged, therefore, that as many people as possible step up to represent these ideas, in order to reach critical-mass awareness in communities around the world as quickly as possible.
		</div><br />

		<h3><a name="1.2. A Chapter in the Zeitgeist Movement"></a>1.2. A Chapter in the Zeitgeist Movement</h3>

		<div>
			The Zeitgeist Movement has an organized structure built, out of necessity, upon chapters that facilitate collective activism as well as the flow of information in an organized manner, relating to a vast range of members worldwide.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Definition</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			A chapter is defined as a self-motivated group of active members of the Zeitgeist Movement in a particular region that serves and functions as an accurate representation of the Movement in their respective region.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Function</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The function of a Chapter is to create and sustain a work-oriented environment from which activism can then be performed in accordance with the understandings supported by the Movement. It is also part of a global Chapter structure for information purposes and larger order activism.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Chapter tiers</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			a) Chapters administration - Composed of international coordinators
		</div>

		<div>
			b) National Chapters - Organized by country (<em>e.g., Portugal, Colombia, New Zealand</em>)
		</div>

		<div>
			c) Regional Chapters - Next tier beneath national according to the specific context of a given country, for example: region / district / state / province
		</div>

		<div>
			d) City Chapters - Level beneath regional according to the specific context of a given state or province, for example - &nbsp;usually a city / suburb / college campus
		</div><br />

		<div>
			These Chapter designations and the differences between them will be explored in greater detail later in this document.
		</div><br />

		<h3><a name="1.3. Getting Real with Expectations"></a>1.3. Getting Real with Expectations</h3>

		<p>As a volunteer movement, activist participation comes from people who derive satisfaction from contributing their time, skills and personal resources toward furthering the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s direction. If an individual is not deriving some sort of satisfaction from their participation, then they will quickly burn out and move on in search of something else that is more satisfying. The level of disappointment or satisfaction an activist experiences is largely impacted by their internal comparison of what actually occurs with their preconceived expectations. It is, therefore, important to become self-aware of any personal expectations concerning three areas in particular that may require adjustments that allow for greater margin of satisfaction. The three areas are: what you expect for a transition to a Resource-Based Economic Model (RBEM), what you expect for the Zeitgeist Movement as a whole, and what you expect in your role as a chapter coordinator.</p>

		<div>
			<strong>What to Expect for a Transition to an RBEM</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The Movement acknowledges that in order for a new sustainable system to be both created and maintained globally, we, as a civilization, need to have both an understanding of the new set of values required to sustain it and a genuine desire to participate in it. This understanding and desire needs to be cultivated by creating critical mass awareness -- essentially a global paradigm shift -- which is the biggest task in bringing an RBE model into existence. We are doing our best to create this paradigm shift by introducing others to these ideas and educating them about the benefits that come with an RBEM as compared with our current monetary system. While we, of course, desire this to happen as soon as possible, and believe the more we step up our activism efforts the better the chances are for accelerating our progress, one quickly finds this enthusiasm is tested daily against the barriers of cultivated ignorance and superstitions perpetuated by the current zeitgeist. There are
			also larger factors largely beyond our control: the depletion and exploitation of natural resources, natural disasters, wars and other conflicts around the world, government and media controls, etc. Thus it is possible that an RBEM is outside the scope of what will occur in one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s lifetime. People who thrive as activists for the long haul are those who see value in simply participating in creating the <em>possibility</em> of an RBEM at some point in the future. In other words, there is a pleasure reward derived from the act of raising awareness that is not dependent upon an immediate outcome or direct benefit. In order to see the changes we wish for we must enact them, as urged by Gandhi, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;You must be the change you wish to see in the world&acirc;&euro;</em>, regardless of whether we live to see such changes personally or not. Any voluteers acting in immediate self-interest are likely to rapidly become disappointed with the pace of
			change.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>What to Expect of the Movement</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			We all come from different experiences with non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations, political organizations, corporations, community groups, perhaps a combination of these, or perhaps none of them. Because of this, people bring all sorts of expectations based on what they have participated in in the past. Some of these expectations are workable within our model and others are not. It helps to understand first how our structure differs from other entities. First of all, we are not an entity that occupies a particular physical space. We have no offices or classrooms specifically designated for our work. Essentially, the entire world is both our classroom and our office. We are global and without boundaries. The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) is not any formal entity by the definition of any government. TZM refers to the hundreds of thousands of activist volunteers worldwide that actively support raising awareness about the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s direction, and
			participate in the existing global communication structure in some way while doing this. The Movement is predefined as an educational effort created by a network of volunteers advocating a move away from a monetary economic system and into an RBE using science and technology for the sustainable management of the earth&acirc;&euro;&trade;s resources. Outside of this, we have adopted a model most similar to the Civil Rights Movement and our non-violent approach to creating change has been inspired by figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Both of these individuals are famously known for their non-violent resistance methods to gain attention and to create opportunities to educate others about new possibilities in order to facilitate a cultural change in values that support positive change.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Expectations of chapter activity within the Movement should take into account the nature of work done on a voluntary basis by intrinsically motivated individuals who are adding the work to their already busy schedules. If, at any time, a person is unable to contribute their time and work due to family, health, relocation, job or other personal matters, it is expected that they may choose to discontinue, or at least, pause their volunteer work. The expectations of a coordinator, therefore, need to allow for varied cycles of productivity that reflect a continuous rotation of new volunteers stepping in and some experienced volunteers stepping out on an ongoing basis. For this reason we try to automate and standardize as much as possible in our communications so that we can easily retain momentum with new volunteers. Despite attempts to facilitate ease of chapter functioning, a certain level of both patience and creative problem-solving are required when working within the
			limitations of volunteers and resources.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>What to Expect as a Chapter Coordinator</strong>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The ideas of this Movement appear self-evident and, as a result, supporters who volunteer to become Chapter coordinators may expect other people to be equally enthusiastic and supportive through action once they become exposed and oriented to the information. Unfortunately, finding volunteers with the same level of acceptance and understanding, having available discretionary time to contribute, and who are actually willing to devote their spare time to this direction, is not so easy. Instead of being frustrated by this state of affairs it helps to understand that this is not due to any shortcomings in those you are dealing with, but, instead, due to the deliberate social design of the Zeitgeist itself, which is to say that most of us are coerced or pressured to live in a form of distressed and distracted wage slavery. As our current socio-economic system continues to break down, people are concerned with their own survival: making ends meet, being able to feed their families,
			and taking care of basic needs. In addition, many people have endured a lifetime of conditioning to be a worker and consumer, allowing others to make their decisions for them instead of adopting self-directed education practices and questioning established institutions. It is also the case that some cultural differences in geographical regions are better poised to be open to learning new, progressive information than other cultures/regions, perhaps due to higher average levels of social awareness or simply more available time to devote to the process. With these understandings, it is important not to become discouraged if you feel like it is taking a while for other volunteers to step up to assist you in planning and executing awareness-raising events and activities. Every chapter once started with at least one person making some kind of effort to share this knowledge with others in some way. &nbsp;Some chapters had only one person spreading information for up to a year before
			they had others step up to assist and the chapter began growing. The important thing is that you are making an effort to inform people of where they can find out about solutions to the problems they perceive if they are interested. You are sowing seeds that may take a while to grow. Coordinators who are self-directed, self-motivated and derive pleasure from simply starting new conversations where they are and enjoy meeting new people tend to fare best over time in getting something started.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Sometimes it is tempting to want to replicate all the larger events that other chapters are doing because you desire that type of event for your community. However, it is important to know your limits and to plan events on a scale relative to the actual level of interest where you are. A suggested path is to start out with small events in the street, cafes, public libraries or community centres. Then, as the chapter grows and more skilled volunteers step forward, it will become possible to begin planning for events with a larger reach. It is helpful to recognize that it is better to plan for an event with 30 seats and end up turning some people away due to being over-capacity than it is to put massive energy and resources into renting a 500-seat, high-tech venue for an event that only 20 people attend. It is safest to plan so that the resources match the level of interest in the community to the best of your chapter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ability and then, even if you have to turn
			people away, this can simply be responded to as feedback for the next event to be slightly larger or to hold the same event again on another day to accommodate more people. Many people begin only virtually, by holding regular online meetings in a Teamspeak channel before meeting in person. However, it is important that, even in the beginning stages, individuals feel comfortable doing face-to-face streets-based or community activism or small meet-ups to begin to connect with people within your community at ground level.

		<h3><a name="1.4. Point of Focus in a chapter"></a>1.4. Point of Focus in a chapter</h3>

		<p>As a chapter, the point of focus should be to educate and generate awareness efficiently in a given area. Chapters have different tiers, and for each tier there is a specific focus. These points of focus are:</p>

		<div>
			- <strong>A National Chapter</strong> should focus on setting up core tools and organization for development into regional chapters, translations, and organizing, creating, developing and adapting content to their region in order to be used by subchapters in local activism.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			- <strong>A Regional Chapter</strong> should focus on relieving the national chapter from the responsibility of expanding into the various regional cities by directly supporting, guiding and promoting these developments. At first, depending on the region&acirc;&euro;&trade;s size, a regional chapter may resemble the activity of a city chapter until it grows enough to be divided into a number of more localized chapters in the same region.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			- <strong>A Local Chapter</strong> should focus on being constantly active in the local area, typically a town, city, or a college campus, by consistently organizing events and always trying to be visible and getting the word out there.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			The Zeitgeist Movement is not a club. It is a worldwide campaign of mass-awareness. The result of creating a local community chapter is that it brings the activity of the Movement to community level -- literally into the backyards of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the masses&acirc;&euro;. Increasing numbers of people have watched <em>Zeitgeist Addendum</em> or <em>Moving Forward</em> films and felt a connection with the message that these documentaries conveyed. It is very important, however, that chapters take this message of hope OFF the Internet and movie screens worldwide, and bring it directly to the people. Only then does it become a message that everyone can participate in and be a part of. Everyone can feel the connection and get involved at whatever level they choose.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Another important fact to note about your local community chapter is that it functions as a gauge regarding the worldwide growth of the Zeitgeist Movement. As these local community chapters expand, so will the message and the enthusiasm. As people around the world continue to see the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s growth they will be eager to learn more about, and become more involved with, these concepts. These local community chapters therefore strengthen the whole movement, being, quite literally, the connection to the masses. Over time this increasing network of worldwide connections will culminate in critical mass.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			A typical concern at this point might be, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Maybe I am not in a big enough location to have a chapter...&acirc;&euro;</em> This is absolutely not true. Chapters are needed EVERYWHERE. If, for example, you live in a small town of 1200 people or less, and you are versed in and motivated by the tenets of the Movement, then you need to start a chapter. Again, that will show that the Movement is everywhere; that people in ALL locations are moved to take action. No location is so insignificant that it should be left out while people living there are motivated to raise awareness and instigate change.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Your job with your chapter is to simply be there; be there as a community presence. It is of paramount importance to become a part of your community. Set up a stall at a small community fair or at a large weekend outdoor music festival and every event in between that you are able to manage. This presence is what makes you a local community chapter of the Zeitgeist Movement.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Always keep in mind that The Zeitgeist Movement is a massive awareness campaign which tries to present the public at large with an alternative message to the current system. The way in which we are able to gauge whether this message is getting through is primarily by the number of new chapters starting up, and, in a secondary way, by the number of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;members&acirc;&euro; within each chapter and its membership growth over time.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>- A Member</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			It is important to clarify what is meant by the term &acirc;&euro;&oelig;member.&acirc;&euro; A local chapter member will be someone who has &acirc;&euro;&oelig;signed up&acirc;&euro; to their local community chapter, meaning they have signed up to your chapter website and/or electronic mailing list. If a chapter has 50 or 100 or 250 &acirc;&euro;&oelig;members,&acirc;&euro; these are simply people who have signed up in this way. It is an extremely simple process in which there are no hoops to jump through, and members do not need to pay any &acirc;&euro;&oelig;membership fee&acirc;&euro;. These people are not required to attend meetings, or be available for every chapter call, or even participate in any way if they don't want to. If your goal is maximal involvement then the reality will quickly become very discouraging as many, if not most, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;members&acirc;&euro; will never participate at such a level. However, you can rest assured that this silent majority of
			the membership does, in fact, advocate for the Movement regardless of how visible their contribution may be. Many do so in their own sphere and interactions, in their conversations, even just in their own minds; and that is an important starting point for the required consciousness-shift.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			One thing that most of these individuals, these &acirc;&euro;&oelig;members&acirc;&euro; or sign-ups, have in common, is that they have seen the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist&acirc;&euro; movies and/or one or more of the many Zeitgeist Movement lectures online, and felt so connected to the message that they &acirc;&euro;&oelig;signed up&acirc;&euro; and became a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;member.&acirc;&euro; This is an example of the success of the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s message, and these sign-ups are a strong gauge of our success.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			There will be two major groups that will make up your chapter. Your members or sign-ups and your &acirc;&euro;&oelig;core&acirc;&euro; team. You should not worry too much about your membership or your sign-ups as this is not your main focus. It is your core team that will become the backbone of your chapter. Simply stated, the core team is the self-realizing group of focused and dedicated individuals that &acirc;&euro;&oelig;get it&acirc;&euro; and consistently show up at chapter meetups, events, and so on. This is the team that will make the local community chapter come alive, and will work to become a highly visible presence within your community.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			How does a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;core&acirc;&euro; team develop? Well, it is <em>you</em> initially; and it will become a group of all the key members who join your chapter and feel the need to take action, and who, as a result, make a strong commitment to building a community presence. Such individuals will step up of their own accord; you do not necessarily need to identify and/or recruit them as they are already self-motivated and will approach you. As a general statement they are all self-managing as well (as per the holographic theme introduced above), they are already up to speed, and they know instinctively what needs to be done. Ideally a core team will consist of two to eight individuals who will bring their talents and strengths to the chapter. It is important to understand that a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;core&acirc;&euro; team cannot become too large as it loses its efficiency past a certain point. Most members who join your chapter will never participate at these levels.
			For mid-level involvement, there is always a need for volunteers who are available and keen to help with specific events and activities.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Now that you have the basic foundation of how a chapter is constituted and how it operates, this section concludes by revisiting the word <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;club.&acirc;&euro;</em> The main reason not to behave as a club or have &acirc;&euro;&oelig;club&acirc;&euro; members is simply that awareness involves constant growth, whereas &acirc;&euro;&oelig;clubs&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;club memberships&acirc;&euro; go up and down -- &acirc;&euro;&oelig;up&acirc;&euro; being positive growth and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;down&acirc;&euro; being negative growth. If you run your chapter with a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;club&acirc;&euro; or "membership participation" mentality you may someday face &acirc;&euro;&oelig;negative&acirc;&euro; growth, with events ranging from occasional member &acirc;&euro;&oelig;unsubscribe&acirc;&euro; opt-outs, or, in the worst-case scenario, whole chapter shakeups. This can lead remaining members to become disappointed and disheartened, and benefits
			no one.
