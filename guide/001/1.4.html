1.4. Point of Focus in a chapter

As a chapter, the point of focus should be to educate and generate awareness efficiently in a given area. Chapters have different tiers, and for each tier there is a specific focus. These points of focus are:
- A National Chapter should focus on setting up core tools and organization for development into regional chapters, translations, and organizing, creating, developing and adapting content to their region in order to be used by subchapters in local activism.

- A Regional Chapter should focus on relieving the national chapter from the responsibility of expanding into the various regional cities by directly supporting, guiding and promoting these developments. At first, depending on the region’s size, a regional chapter may resemble the activity of a city chapter until it grows enough to be divided into a number of more localized chapters in the same region.

- A Local Chapter should focus on being constantly active in the local area, typically a town, city, or a college campus, by consistently organizing events and always trying to be visible and getting the word out there.

The Zeitgeist Movement is not a club. It is a worldwide campaign of mass-awareness. The result of creating a local community chapter is that it brings the activity of the Movement to community level -- literally into the backyards of “the masses”. Increasing numbers of people have watched Zeitgeist Addendum or Moving Forward films and felt a connection with the message that these documentaries conveyed. It is very important, however, that chapters take this message of hope OFF the Internet and movie screens worldwide, and bring it directly to the people. Only then does it become a message that everyone can participate in and be a part of. Everyone can feel the connection and get involved at whatever level they choose.

Another important fact to note about your local community chapter is that it functions as a gauge regarding the worldwide growth of the Zeitgeist Movement. As these local community chapters expand, so will the message and the enthusiasm. As people around the world continue to see the Movement’s growth they will be eager to learn more about, and become more involved with, these concepts. These local community chapters therefore strengthen the whole movement, being, quite literally, the connection to the masses. Over time this increasing network of worldwide connections will culminate in critical mass.

A typical concern at this point might be, “Maybe I am not in a big enough location to have a chapter...” This is absolutely not true. Chapters are needed EVERYWHERE. If, for example, you live in a small town of 1200 people or less, and you are versed in and motivated by the tenets of the Movement, then you need to start a chapter. Again, that will show that the Movement is everywhere; that people in ALL locations are moved to take action. No location is so insignificant that it should be left out while people living there are motivated to raise awareness and instigate change.

Your job with your chapter is to simply be there; be there as a community presence. It is of paramount importance to become a part of your community. Set up a stall at a small community fair or at a large weekend outdoor music festival and every event in between that you are able to manage. This presence is what makes you a local community chapter of the Zeitgeist Movement.

Always keep in mind that The Zeitgeist Movement is a massive awareness campaign which tries to present the public at large with an alternative message to the current system. The way in which we are able to gauge whether this message is getting through is primarily by the number of new chapters starting up, and, in a secondary way, by the number of “members” within each chapter and its membership growth over time.

- A Member
It is important to clarify what is meant by the term “member.” A local chapter member will be someone who has “signed up” to their local community chapter, meaning they have signed up to your chapter website and/or electronic mailing list. If a chapter has 50 or 100 or 250 “members,” these are simply people who have signed up in this way. It is an extremely simple process in which there are no hoops to jump through, and members do not need to pay any “membership fee”. These people are not required to attend meetings, or be available for every chapter call, or even participate in any way if they don't want to. If your goal is maximal involvement then the reality will quickly become very discouraging as many, if not most, “members” will never participate at such a level. However, you can rest assured that this silent majority of the membership does, in fact, advocate for the Movement regardless of how visible their contribution may be. Many do so in their own sphere and interactions, in their conversations, even just in their own minds; and that is an important starting point for the required consciousness-shift.

One thing that most of these individuals, these “members” or sign-ups, have in common, is that they have seen the “Zeitgeist” movies and/or one or more of the many Zeitgeist Movement lectures online, and felt so connected to the message that they “signed up” and became a “member.” This is an example of the success of the Movement’s message, and these sign-ups are a strong gauge of our success.

There will be two major groups that will make up your chapter. Your members or sign-ups and your “core” team. You should not worry too much about your membership or your sign-ups as this is not your main focus. It is your core team that will become the backbone of your chapter. Simply stated, the core team is the self-realizing group of focused and dedicated individuals that “get it” and consistently show up at chapter meetups, events, and so on. This is the team that will make the local community chapter come alive, and will work to become a highly visible presence within your community.

How does a “core” team develop? Well, it is you initially; and it will become a group of all the key members who join your chapter and feel the need to take action, and who, as a result, make a strong commitment to building a community presence. Such individuals will step up of their own accord; you do not necessarily need to identify and/or recruit them as they are already self-motivated and will approach you. As a general statement they are all self-managing as well (as per the holographic theme introduced above), they are already up to speed, and they know instinctively what needs to be done. Ideally a core team will consist of two to eight individuals who will bring their talents and strengths to the chapter. It is important to understand that a “core” team cannot become too large as it loses its efficiency past a certain point. Most members who join your chapter will never participate at these levels. For mid-level involvement, there is always a need for volunteers who are available and keen to help with specific events and activities.

Now that you have the basic foundation of how a chapter is constituted and how it operates, this section concludes by revisiting the word “club.” The main reason not to behave as a club or have “club” members is simply that awareness involves constant growth, whereas “clubs” and “club memberships” go up and down -- “up” being positive growth and “down” being negative growth. If you run your chapter with a “club” or "membership participation" mentality you may someday face “negative” growth, with events ranging from occasional member “unsubscribe” opt-outs, or, in the worst-case scenario, whole chapter shakeups. This can lead remaining members to become disappointed and disheartened, and benefits no one.
