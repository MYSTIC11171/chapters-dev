1.1. Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to assist and facilitate the creation and development of any kind of Chapter within The Zeitgeist Movement. Topics include, but are not limited to: organizing a core group; organizing local events and projects; setting up communication mediums; how to deal with “noise” in the chapter, etc.

Before reading this document and creating a chapter, it is highly recommended to read or view the Zeitgeist Movement Orientation Guide (found at www.thezeitgeistmovement.com) in order to comprehend the Movement’s overall aims and ethos, and understandings around the global Resource-Based Economic Model (RBEM) it advocates.

A core logical conclusion of the Movement, as derived from empirical evidence pertaining to economic and environmental sustainability, and sociocultural issues, is that, in order to move toward a sustainable, peaceful and happy future on this planet, the monetary system must be replaced. This is due to it being inherently and irredeemably flawed as well as being responsible, either directly or indirectly, for a large proportion of destruction in the world. It is in the key focus area of educating the world that the millennia-old monetary system is now obsolete that the Zeitgeist Movement is, indeed, standing on the doorstep of history. The manifestation of the Movement at the local community level -- its most visible focal point to the populous -- is the global network of local chapters worldwide. Therefore, by starting and building a local chapter in accordance with the tenets and understandings of the Movement, you are personally adding to this unfolding history in a very positive way.

As in most documents, within this one there is the necessary use of very basic but potentially polarizing terms such as “we,” “us,” “they,” them,” and their derivatives, within the context of larger phrases. Although such phrasing is natural for drawing distinctions and lends itself to properly conveying the subject material, it is critical to understand that there is truly no “us versus them” within the Zeitgeist Movement. It is all “us”, globally, as we are all, in the end, one people sharing this single fragile planet. This needs to be your mindset as you apply yourself to activism with the Movement.

Unlike most movements and organizations today that operate according to a hierarchical system, “our” purpose takes shape around a shared set of understandings, which is the body of ideas that “we” have collectively agreed to support, and hope that others eventually do too. This allows the Movement to be leaderless and holographic in nature, operating on a basis of voluntary contribution and consensus. Both the concept and role of “leader” become redundant when groups share responsibility for completing tasks, making decisions, and achieving outcomes.

Thus, regardless of the path of education and awareness that got them to this point, any person who becomes consciously aware of, and advocates for, the aims and ethos of the Movement, becomes an immediate representative of the Movement at any point they choose to become one. From here it is only a small step further to spread awareness, start a Chapter, and contribute to the Movement. It is naturally encouraged, therefore, that as many people as possible step up to represent these ideas, in order to reach critical-mass awareness in communities around the world as quickly as possible.
