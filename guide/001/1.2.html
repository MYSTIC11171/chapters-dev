1.2. A Chapter in the Zeitgeist Movement

The Zeitgeist Movement has an organized structure built, out of necessity, upon chapters that facilitate collective activism as well as the flow of information in an organized manner, relating to a vast range of members worldwide.

Definition

A chapter is defined as a self-motivated group of active members of the Zeitgeist Movement in a particular region that serves and functions as an accurate representation of the Movement in their respective region.

Function

The function of a Chapter is to create and sustain a work-oriented environment from which activism can then be performed in accordance with the understandings supported by the Movement. It is also part of a global Chapter structure for information purposes and larger order activism.

Chapter tiers

a) Chapters administration - Composed of international coordinators
b) National Chapters - Organized by country (e.g., Portugal, Colombia, New Zealand)

d) City Chapters - Level beneath regional according to the specific context of a given state or province, for example -  usually a city / suburb / college campus

These Chapter designations and the differences between them will be explored in greater detail later in this document.
