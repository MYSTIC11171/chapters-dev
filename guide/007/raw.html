		<h2><a name="getting-the" id="getting-the"></a>7.1 - Getting the most out of Meetings</h2><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Facilitate</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			An important role within a given chapter at any level is the ability to facilitate at meetings, either physical or online. The facilitator&acirc;&euro;&trade;s role is to facilitate the process of the meeting and assist with attaining optimal outcomes for all involved in decision-making processes. A good facilitator is particularly helpful when a group is trying to deal with new or difficult issues. In the main, a facilitator helps people persevere as they confront the inevitable confusion and frustration associated with trying to integrate different views and approaches with their own. The more people who learn to facilitate, the better. If you accept the role of facilitator you must be neutral. You should also use the following techniques.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Watch group vibes</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			If people seem bored or inattentive, you may have to speed up the pace of the meeting. If people seem tense because of unvoiced disagreements, you may have to bring concerns out into the open.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Make sure everyone gets a chance to speak</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Invite quiet people to speak. If necessary, use the clock, for example: <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We have fifteen minutes left. I think we should hear from people who haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t spoken for a while.&acirc;&euro;</em> Another way to get quiet people to speak is to initiate a round, in which you move around the table, with everyone getting a few minutes to present their views.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Encourage open discussion</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Try to encourage people to speak up if they seem reluctant to disagree with a speaker, for example: <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;On difficult issues, people may well disagree. Does anyone have a different point of view?&acirc;&euro;</em> Another way to encourage open discussion is to ask participants to avoid using critical language for a period of time.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Draw people out with open-ended questions</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Open-ended questions require more than a yes/no answer. Some examples may be:
		</div>

		<div>
			<em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;We seem to be having trouble here. What do you think we should do?&acirc;&euro;<br />
			&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Could you say more about that?&acirc;&euro;<br />
			&acirc;&euro;&oelig;What do you mean when you say...?&acirc;&euro;</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Inject humor</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Humor is one of the best ways of improving the tone of meetings. It makes meetings seem like friendly get-togethers.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Paraphrase</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			When you paraphrase, you try to restate, briefly, the point that someone has just made, for example: <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Let me see if I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m understanding you correctly...&acirc;&euro;</em> If paraphrasing doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t convince a person that he or she has been heard, you may have to retrace the discussion, repeat what was said verbatim, etc.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Learn to deal with difficult behavior:</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Flare-ups</strong> &mdash; When two members get into a heated discussion, summarize the points made by each and then turn the discussion back to the group.
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Grandstanding</strong> &mdash; Interrupt the one-person show with a statement that gives credit for his or her&nbsp;contribution, but ask the person to reserve other points for later.
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Broken record</strong> &mdash; Paraphrase the contribution of someone who repeats the same point over and over. This lets the person know they have been heard.
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Interrupting</strong> &mdash; Step in immediately, for example: <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Hold on, let Margaret finish what she has to say.&acirc;&euro;</em>
		</div>

		<div>
			<strong>Continual criticizing</strong> &mdash; Legitimize negative feelings on difficult issues. You might say, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Yes, it will be tough to reduce traffic congestion on Main Street, but there are successful models we can look at.&acirc;&euro;</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Identify areas of common ground.</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Summarize differences in points of view, then note where there is common ground. For instance, you might begin with, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It seems we agree that . . . &acirc;&euro;</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Suggest options when time runs out.</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Identify areas of partial consensus, suggest tabling the question, or create small groups to deal with the matter at their convenience.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Consider a round at the end of the meeting.</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Going quickly around the whole group at the end of the meeting gives people a chance to bring up matters not on the agenda. You can also use a round to evaluate the meeting. With more than ten people, though, a round can become tedious.
		</div><br />

		<h2><a name="keeping-people" id="keeping-people"></a>7.2 - Keeping People</h2><br />

		<div>
			People join community groups to meet people, to have fun, to learn new skills, to pursue an interest, and to link their lives to some higher purpose. They leave if they don't find what they are looking for. Groups need to ask themselves more often: What benefits do we provide? At what cost to members? How can we increase the benefits and decrease the costs? Here are a some ideas on where to begin.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Stay in touch with one another</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Regular contact is vital. Face to face is best. If you have the ability to meet, getting together at someone's house is more sociable than meeting in a public place or hall, and is usually more conducive to getting things accomplished. That said, if a central rendezvous location, such as a restaurant or bar, is logistically preferable, that is fine too, although it might be a bit noisier.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Welcome newcomers</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Introduce them to members of your group. Consider appointing greeters for large meetings and events.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Help people find a place within the organization. For example, if a member shows &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fired up&acirc;&euro; but unfocused motivation, an appealing approach is to say, <em>"Tell us the things you like to do and do well and we will find a way to use those talents."</em> The next most appealing invitation (which also encourages self-management) is: <em>"Here are some of the things we have to do, but how you get them done is up to you."</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In summary, make it a point to invite newcomers to become more autonomous and proactive. If the same people do everything, newcomers feel excluded.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Pay attention to group process</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Most volunteer groups do not give adequate attention to how they work together. Decision-making methods are not determined explicitly, nor are roles or healthy behaviors. To address this, some groups make process itself a topic of discussion by appointing a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;process watcher.&acirc;&euro;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Act more, meet less</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			The great majority of people detest meetings; too many are the Black Death of community groups. By comparison, activities like tree-planting draw large numbers of people of all ages. Therefore, it is perfectly acceptable to schedule your meetings only when a certain project or event needs to be planned. Such &acirc;&euro;&oelig;on-demand&acirc;&euro; meetings are a natural way to ease into regularly scheduled chapter meetings, if and when you decide such regular meetings are needed. The Chapter can still meet up regularly for social events, screenings, workshops, and streets-based activism, etc., without feeling overburdened with the formality of meetings.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Keep time demands modest</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Most people lead busy lives. Don't ask them to come to meetings if they don't need to be there. Keep expanding the number of active members to ensure everyone does a little, and no one does too much. Work out realistic time commitments for projects.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Do it in twos</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			We suggest working in pairs. It improves the quality of communication, makes work less lonely, and ensures tasks get done. Ethnically mixed pairs (such as English and Chinese) can maintain links to different cultures. Gender mixed pairs can take advantage of different ways men and women relate to one another. Various other pairings can be experimented with.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Provide social time and activities</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Endless work drives people away. Schedule social time at the beginning and end of meetings. Turn routine tasks into social events. Some activist groups might form a group of friends and sometimes plan meet-ups or dinners.
		</div>

		<div>
			<em><strong>Note</strong> - if formal topics are on the agenda, it is in everyone&acirc;&euro;&trade;s best interest, and makes for a more&nbsp;productive meeting, if drinks and other libations are placed on hold until after the meeting.</em>
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Provide skills training</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Many people step out of private life in order to learn something they enjoy. Providing training, and/or weaving training into activism, is one of the best ways to get and keep people.
		</div><br />

		<h2><a name="common-problems" id="common-problems"></a>7.3 - Common Problems and Hazards</h2><br />

		<div>
			This section aims to draw attention to the common hazards or problems that a chapter may face, based on problems that have occurred in the Movement. Pay attention, better safe than sorry!
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Special Interest Groups</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Be friends with other activist groups, even consider holding collaborative events together, but avoid forming complex alliances or become dependent on them. Many, although certainly not all, other activist groups exist as a result of the current monetary system and, intentionally or not, are stuck in that paradigm; thus some of their philosophies are fundamentally rooted in premises rather different, and perhaps even contrary to the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s global RBEM approach.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Sadly, it has been experienced in some cases that some such parties &acirc;&euro;&oelig;target&acirc;&euro; chapter members as recruits to their cause and to ignore ours in the process. In this regard we must ensure that we always focus on our solutions and not become sidetracked by theirs, and stick close to the well-established concepts and principles of The Zeitgeist Movement. This does not, of course, preclude learning from other organizations, however; it is simply a matter of maintaining a balance whereby collaboration and learning do not turn into working on behalf of another organization and/or replacing elements of the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s core tenets with theirs.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Chapters may also receive some less-than welcoming responses from the activist community, some fearing a loss of their own members or a slowing in new recruits, and others being so strongly identified with their own organization or agenda as to reject all others rather than look for common ground or collaboration.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Interpersonal Conflicts</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			To simplify, always refer to The Zeitgeist Movement to resolve conflicts, since we have strong common goals. Keep the strategies simple. Struggles for "power" can arise, so always strive to maintain a kind disposition and professional manner. If a conflict arises AVOID DISCUSSING IT IN PUBLIC, especially in a forum. Resolutions and discussions should happen in private or in virtual meetings moderated by a third person. Remain professional and never do anything extreme or emotionally charged.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Challenges to Privacy</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Be aware that most core tenets of the Movement are open to potential abuse, or at least, misappropriation, in cases where a dissatisfied individual or group may take issue with an individual, group, plan or project. The core tenet of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;transparency&acirc;&euro;, though vital to the horizontal functioning of the Movement, is potentially prone to misuse with the challenge that there should&nbsp;be no privacy, that all matters great and small should be out in the open and voted/acted upon&acirc;&euro;&oelig;democratically&acirc;&euro; across the membership, and so on. It is important to recognize when matters need to be dealt with out in the open, or whether they do, in fact, require some privacy, as in some instances of conflict resolution. Do not allow yourself to be drawn into inappropriate public debates through the hijacking of the concept of transparency. Everyone is entitled to some personal privacy, especially with regard to feelings, opinions and
			decisions about another person. Where this line is (that is, what fairly constitutes a legitimate larger scale issue vs. just a misaligned personal agenda) is a judgement call on your part. When in doubt however, again, always seek advice from the Movement.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Extremism</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			This is a movement/community for all. Do not isolate your group by restricting activism to certain groups of people. Do not associate yourselves with alcohol, drugs, offensive behavior or fear&nbsp;doctrines. Always keep the group open to all sorts of cultures and people of all ages. Be positive and focused on solutions. Tell people a message of hope and offer solutions that are empirically verifiable and demonstrable.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too little fun</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Long-term activists have fun when they get together. People who take themselves too seriously can turn any task into a chore. Getting together should feel more like recreation than work, no matter how serious the issue. Those who understand this level of involvement stress the importance of having fun as equal to completing the many tasks at hand.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too much emphasis on organization and too little on mission</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Hoping to become more organized, many small groups create little bureaucracies that drain everyone's energy. Often so much effort goes into maintaining the organization that there is little left to pursue the reason for creating the organization in the first place. Keep administrative tasks to a bare minimum.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too many meetings and too little action</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Most people would prefer to act on something concrete rather than sit at a meeting wrangling or trying to "reach consensus". Some meetings are usually necessary, but try to keep the frequency down, the time short, and the number of participants small.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			A related problem is too much criticism and too little creating. Every advocacy group needs to generate options for action. To do this well, participants need to switch off their &acirc;&euro;&oelig;voice of judgement&acirc;&euro;, and surrender to some brainstorming. Unfortunately, when people get together for a meeting they usually switch on their &acirc;&euro;&oelig;voice of judgement&acirc;&euro; in preparation for decision making. If they remain in this critical frame of mind, they will generate few options for action; nothing will get done, and no one will have any fun.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too many people</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Because of the emphasis on getting more people involved, many people feel that large groups are better than small groups. This is a mistake. A working group should not exceed nine people. This is the upper limit of what sociologists call a primary group. A small group does not preclude working with others under the umbrella of a larger group; nor does it prelude communicating with larger numbers of people through email networks, special events and annual conventions.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>The wrong people</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Because building a movement involves working with others, most people assume they should welcome anyone interested in joining. However, this impulse can lead to rapid decline. Few are willing to admit what is obvious in any group: some people are assets and others are liabilities.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			While every group can handle a small portion of people who are very angry, very combative, very controlling or very lonely, as the ratio of these people increases, level-headed, friendly, competent people begin to leave. As the imbalance increases, even more leave the group. In order to avert this you must be mentally prepared to take charge at the outset, at the first sign of trouble, especially with negative people. For example, for an obvious angry troll, a tacit and polite response here might be, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;It sounds like you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re not entirely in line with what the Movement is doing here. Perhaps there are other organizations that are more in line with your views.&acirc;&euro;</em>, or an alternative that is comfortable for your own temperament.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too little contact</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			It is hard for people to&nbsp;maintain a working relationship when they only see one another once a month. As your group becomes more active, once a week may be better, not only because it is more frequent, but because it fits into the way people schedule other activities. If regular face-to-face contact is difficult, regular phone calls, email or online communication such as TeamSpeak, may work as a substitute.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too little time</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			The greatest barrier to participating in public life is the shortage of discretionary free time. In surging market economies people spend most of their time working and consuming, leaving little time for friends and family, and no time for civic involvement. In declining market economies these same people may have time but not money, not even for gas or a bus fare. Again, this is an inherent condition of the present &acirc;&euro;&oelig;wage-slave&acirc;&euro; Zeitgeist that we all must deal with.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Too short term</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			If a group has coalesced around accomplishing a particular end, participants need to realize that keeping up the pressure over an extended time-period is essential. Expectations of quick victory need to be tempered with the understanding that opponents to change are most often successful just because they hold out longer. They know that if they don't budge, most activists will become discouraged and retreat back into private life. Groups need to maintain their enthusiasm and recognize that if their cause is just, they will indeed prevail. As Gandhi said: <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&acirc;&euro;</em> But it takes time.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>Objectives outmatch resources</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Groups of nine or less can often support themselves on personal resources. However, as group size increases, a shortage of money and time usually leads to spiralling decline. Without paid staff there is no one to look after organizational housekeeping, and no one to train, manage and reward volunteers. As people disappear, many active members burn out trying to do more and more themselves. A lack of resources does not mean giving up. It does, however, mean inventing clever ways to use time, connections and skills.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			In summary: limit group size, make sure members enjoy one another's company, have fun, avoid&nbsp;over-stretching resources, and don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get sidetracked or put off by any issues that arise.&nbsp;
		</div>
