		<p dir="ltr">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;First, I have become acutely aware of the broad diversity in the levels of understanding of people in general and their ability to grasp the reasons for the TZM direction. Related to this, I have come to recognize that many people will be attracted to TZM for a broad number of reasons but very few will be capable and willing to grasp the core direction. These few are the ones who will form the core groups eventually, I hope. Meanwhile, there are so many tasks needing to be accomplished and so few people with the needed understandings, skills, opportunity and motivation. So my advice is, don't get discouraged. If you get it, others will also. Those are the ones you are looking for. The rest of the folks are there to be educated to one extent or another and will find their own level of involvement. As a coordinator, our role is to meet the various needs of all the people that are attracted to TZM based on their own level of understanding and
		commitment while maintaining the focus of the present TZM purpose, i.e. spreading awareness as widely as possible with the aim of reaching critical mass.&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;In case you're on your own, wanting to start a chapter and you were wondering about support or training... new coordinators can go to other coordinators for help. Look for successful coordinators or active chapters for guidelines on organization, or the way they run their chapter, or ideas for website design. There were a few people who helped me with setting up our website and hosting. Coordinators Jen, Darr, Cliff to name a few, and there are several more qualified people available because it's possible you have little experience starting a chapter even though you have abilities that make you suited for coordinating a chapter.&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">Over 2 years ago, when this chapter started, I had problems with disruptive personalities and conflicts with people in the process that resulted in unnecessary drama I was unprepared for, and I lacked training on social therapy. There were many of the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Common Problems&acirc;&euro; mentioned above especially a club or hang-out/social mentality, making it difficult to plan events. Seek advice or private mediation if this is the case so you can focus on activism and organization. After everything calmed down, being a coordinator has been a good experience and we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve moved along nicely.&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">A good goal for a new chapter would be to have 1 activism event (Town Hall or street activism) a month and regular TS3 meetings, and to be consistent. I would say consistency has been our mantra. When people see that something is happening you will be able to develop a core team of 2 - 8 people who will help.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">I coordinated alone for 16 months. We now have 4 core members and an ASU University Chapter. So, be willing to "show up" even if no one else does - yes, that happened to me a few times. In time, you will do well if you're dedicated to educating the community on this direction."</p>

		Take opportunities to foster supporters&acirc;&euro;&trade; interests in building social connection with each other. Encourage projects that go beyond street activism in order to retain active supporters.&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;First of all, know the need to commit, then commit. If you are working a full time job it will be harder than if you have more free time. Get involved with other groups like Occupy and share the influence of the ideas presented by TZM. Do not attempt to co-opt when attending with other movements. The evidence speaks for itself. Your job is to make the information available. When having discussion, avoid lines of contention, always look for common ground. Ask people what they would want in a future society and know how to answer it in regard to the functioning capability of a RBE.&acirc;&euro;</p>

		<p style="text-align: right;" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Utilise any momentum and activity your chapter gains as much as possible.<br />
		<br />
		Make sure to communicate and amplify the fact that this is a leaderless movement and, as such, input from all people is equal.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">Try and include and encourage as many members as possible in all activity. Without doing this heirarchy and dependance will stagnate the chapter.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">Most importantly, try and put emphasis on spreading the "methodology" that the Movement is based upon (the workings of the scientific method). Without this mass understanding all the people in the world won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t make any difference.&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;</p>

		<h2 dir="ltr"><a name="tips-on-dvds" id="tips-on-dvds"></a>Tips on DVDs</h2>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Single layer DVDs are relatively cheap, and prices continue to drop. More so than any other organization out there in this fleeting DVD era, whether intentionally or not, the Movement has capitalized on this by establishing free DVD handouts as a de-facto basic awareness-raising strategy of most local chapters worldwide. When you stop and think of the sheer density of information on a DVD, i.e., one of the Movement&acirc;&euro;&trade;s &acirc;&euro;&oelig;trademark&acirc;&euro; full-length feature films, then combine that with the DVD&acirc;&euro;&trade;s durability, ubiquity, compact size, and cheap price, it truly represents one of the most powerful promotional tools at our disposal! No one else does this!</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quantity</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">The amount of DVDs to have available for handing out at events varies according to the size of the event, its duration, and the traffic at your booth. However, be advised that for larger events hundreds of DVDs can be handed out in no time at all. At the Chicago Peace Fest in 2011, for example, the entire stockpile of 700 DVDs was handed out on a single Saturday, and this with several hours still left to go that evening! Hence looking forward to larger events, it may not be uncommon to plan on say 1000 DVDs to hand out for a 1-day event, or, say, 2000 for a full weekend event.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>DVD Type</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Each of Peter Joseph&acirc;&euro;&trade;s first two movies (&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Addendum&acirc;&euro;) can fit uncompressed onto a single-layer (4.7GB) DVD. Two movies together, or perhaps one movie and several lectures, can introduce compression and affect the video quality, although in normal viewing situations on a PC or even a larger home monitor, this seems barely noticeable. Dual-layer (9GB) DVDs are almost double the capacity of a standard single layer and technically should be used for the third movie &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist: Moving Forward,&acirc;&euro; and beyond. That said, in actual use, again, single layer DVDs seem to work and view just fine and are much cheaper.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Procurement &amp; Process</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Typically you buy the blank DVDs in bulk, burn them yourself (one at time unless you score a multi-burner or make it a team project), label them, and stuff them into cheap paper DVD sleeves. You can even have some fun with these last two tasks by throwing a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;DVD stuffing party&acirc;&euro; and inviting fellow members over. However, DVDs are still more expensive than, say, business cards or flyers. If they are relatively precious to you in this regard due to a tight budget, it is no problem: simply reserve your small count for only individuals that display serious interest.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Content</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">The next question is what exactly to burn onto the DVDs. Assuming for simplicity you want one movie, the question remains: which one? Well, the latest &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist: Moving Forward&acirc;&euro; is the obvious pick - that is, until Z4, titled &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Beyond the Pale&acirc;&euro; is released in late 2012. However, there may be another equally valid candidate here, which is &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist: Addendum.&acirc;&euro; Think about it - as the world continues its inevitable slow death march into global financial collapse, more and more people will have one thing on their minds, MONEY. A superb, detailed tutorial on the MONETARY system (eventually exposing its fraudulent nature) is exactly where &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist Addendum&acirc;&euro; starts! What a hook!! You can clarify to your DVD recipient that this is the middle movie, so to speak, so they understand this, then leave the rest up to them to pick up the other films on
		their own.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">In the end, the choice of content for any DVD handouts is a personal one, so pick whatever you are comfortable with. You can even have a small selection if you have the means to do so.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Downloading</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Now that you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve picked your movie, the next step is to download or copy it from somewhere, then to your blank DVD. Now, you can copy files, jpgs, or any other content you wish to a DVD, and it becomes a data DVD. However, typically if you want to create a movie DVD what you will need is the movie&acirc;&euro;&trade;s single raw image file, i.e., the ISO file, so named due to its .iso extension. If you have (or can get) an existing DVD of the movie, &nbsp;you can simply rip a copy of its ISO image to your disk drive. Otherwise this file is typically downloaded from an online location whose link is posted in a TZM forum someplace, or alternately via a file sharing service like BitTorrent. If occurring in real-time (for example the global ZMF download exercise in Jan 2011), links are provided directly by Peter. But regardless of how you get it, again the ISO file is what&acirc;&euro;&trade;s needed and is by far the simplest way to proceed. Note- be
		sure to select the proper TV format for your region: NTSC (for most of the Americas and Canada) or PAL (for Europe and elsewhere).</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>How long will it take?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Assuming the rather large image size of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist: Moving Forward&acirc;&euro; for example, the ISO file is approximately 6.9GB (that's gigabytes). Let's round that up to 7GB and use the following table:</p>

		<p dir="ltr">If your net speed is near: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will move: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your download will take:&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">278KB/sec (~2.8mb/s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GB/hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~7 hours<br />
		139KB/sec (~1.4mb/s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Acirc;&frac12; GB/hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~14 hours<br />
		70KB/sec &nbsp;(~700kb/s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Acirc;&frac14; GB/hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~28 hours<br />
		35KB/sec &nbsp;(~350kb/s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&acirc;&hellip;&rsaquo; GB/hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~56 hours</p>

		<p dir="ltr">... etc.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">If your estimated download time is prohibitive to you or you just can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be bothered, consider getting a master copy of the movie some other way: through a friend, ordering it through the <a href="http://zeitgeistmovie.com/">zeitgeistmovie.com</a> website, or other means. Alternately, try finding a faster connection.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>To Burn or Not to Burn</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Now that you have the ISO image file of your movie(s) of choice, you typically proceed to the Burning task (below). However, a situation may exist where you can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do this or choose not to. For example your DVD player/burner is broken on your PC or laptop. Or perhaps you need to show your movie at an event today, have no blank DVDs handy and won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have time to buy some and burn a copy. What to do? Well, in a pinch, you can use DVD emulation software like MagicDisc here: <a href="http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm">http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm</a></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Mount your ISO file up as a MagicDisc virtual drive and try to PLAY it with the player software on your PC. If successful, you can show your movie at your event using this setup, with no physical DVD. That said, this is usually the exception to the rule of having multiple real DVDs to hand out.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>To Shrink or not to Shrink</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, although the first two movies (&acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist&acirc;&euro; and &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Addendum&acirc;&euro;) and also the various lectures are smaller in size and can fit easily onto a single-layer DVD, the newer &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Zeitgeist Moving Forward&acirc;&euro; ISO image file exceeds the capacity of a 4.7GB single-layer DVD, and must be compressed to fit using a technique called shrinking. In this case, download and run the suggested DvdShrink tool against the file first:</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/software/general/download_splash.cfm/dvd_shrink">http://www.afterdawn.com/software/general/download_splash.cfm/dvd_shrink</a><br />
		<br />
		The rough steps after unzipping and installing are:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Select File&gt;Open Disc Image, and select your ISO file</li>

			<li>Click the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Backup&acirc;&euro;&trade; Button</li>

			<li>Select the drive with your blank DVD disc</li>

			<li>Click Okay and the process of encoding begins. It might take 3-5 minutes. It will then burn the new file to the DVD and it should function exactly like a regular DVD.</li>
		</ol>

		<p dir="ltr"><br />
		That's it. Test it in your player. If OK, save off the shrunk file so you can skip this step next time.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Burning</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Assuming you are ready with your ISO file but are new to burning DVDs, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t fret; it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s easy. The free tool of choice is ImgBurn, available at imgburn.com, and it is ridiculously easy to use. Its intuitive main screen is shown below:<br />
		<br />
		<img width="549px;" height="375px;" border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Orz7hl2jkNsBDxNV3qkudhrjzH5FOm4zzZ728cYfrI6JMRJFxP38mcIp4NyGOywoDeX7nAgWT_00aFhhd7JMlpLG5vE3r47Nvc1-J36t3LRtQn4mZLg" /></p>

		<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr">As you can see it has several 'modes', each one for performing a different task. The most useful of these will be:&nbsp;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Create - Read from a disc to an image file (for copying from a master DVD)</li>

			<li>Build - Create an image file from files on your computer or network - or you can write the files directly to a disc</li>

			<li>Write - Write an image file to a disc &lt;&lt; This is the main button to use (upper left)</li>

			<li>Verify - Check a disc is 100% readable. Optionally, you can also have ImgBurn compare it against a given image file to ensure the actual data is correct</li>
		</ul>

		<p dir="ltr">Once you click the create button, a setup screen appears where you can select your source file, your destination drive, quantity, and option to Verify or not. Then just click the Burn icon and wait.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>The burn finished with success. Now what?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Simple: PLAY the DVD, preferably in a regular player, FROM START TO FINISH, as a final test to ensure you have a clean DVD with no jitters or dropouts. If you encounter even one, you should consider burning a new DVD, then viewing it again in its entirety, until you get a golden copy. &nbsp;Once you have accomplished this, you can trust your &acirc;&euro;&oelig;gold&acirc;&euro; ISO image file for bulk replication.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Common Problems</strong><br />
		<br />
		<strong>- What if I get an immediate error when starting the burn?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">It's an indication that something is not compatible. For example some units can READ a given format (say dual layer or blu-ray) but not WRITE them. Double check your drive specs.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>- What if I get a write error part way through the burn? Am I doing something wrong?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">No. Not every blank DVD is perfect, and sometimes it takes a retry with a new blank. Be patient.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>- What if I continue to get write errors across multiple blanks?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Try adjusting the burn speed slower. Usually the auto setting will suffice, but not always.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>- What if I get a clean burn &amp; Verify but the movie won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t load and/or play properly?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">You may have a corrupt ISO image file. If checksums are available against the ISO file, verify the published checksums against your copy using an MD5 checksum checker tool (for example at www.fastsum.com). If it's not a match you will need to download (or copy) the ISO file again.</p>

		<p dir="ltr"><strong>- What if no matter what I can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t get the burn done?</strong></p>

		<p dir="ltr">Short term, consider just playing the ISO file using MagicDisc or equivalent software right off your PC, and connecting your video output to the projector inputs at your event. Long term: have your setup checked out by a PC technician.</p>
