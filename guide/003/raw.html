		<h2><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>3.1 - Overview</h2>

		<p>The particularities of a regional Chapter are that it can be formed either as an expansion of a city Chapter, or a subdivision of a national Chapter. It may also be the case that a regional Chapter is set up as an interim measure and as a way to facilitate activity and communication in sparsely populated areas where there are initially too few people in a town to establish a local Chapter, yet sufficient interest spread across the region. This may be a situation more familiar to Chapters in large countries with small populations spread over vast areas with lengthy travelling distances between, such as Australia or Canada. The regional Chapter is structured in a way that gathers city Chapters from the same region, province, district, or state. It also gathers people from a given region who live in cities but have not yet formed a city Chapter.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>There are three ways in which regional Chapters are likely to develop:</p>

		<p>1) From the centre-out, as the number of local Chapters within a country increases to the point at which it is necessary for coordination to be divided according to region in order to spread the workload and facilitate smooth communication.</p>

		<p>2) From the top-down as TZM gains traction within a country and interest grows to a point at which various regions wish to establish their own activities. These regional Chapters are likely to gradually become more and more localized as interest and activity increase and numbers build in the various localities.</p>

		<p>3) From the bottom-up, as local Chapters find that, with increasing numbers, networking and collaboration become increasingly useful and a regional framework is established to facilitate this.</p>

		<p>It must be noted that, regardless of whether a regional Chapter develops in a centre-out, top-down, or bottom-up manner, it is of paramount importance that communication with national coordination be maintained. Such communication is integral to the healthy functioning of a globally networked movement as it facilitates development of ideas and projects as well as providing support to each Chapter. If all Chapters are effectively networked and supported resources will be equally accessible, thus reducing the workload of each individual Chapter, and all will be equally accountable for upholding the integrity of the Movement.</p><br />

		<h2><a name="getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>3.2 - Getting Started</h2><br />

		<div>
			In its beginnings, a regional chapter often resembles the processes of a city chapter due to the relatively limited size and geographical coverage. The only major differences are that a regional chapter:
		</div>

		<div>
			- Gathers members from all the various cities in a region
		</div>

		<div>
			- Is focused on expansion (creating more city chapters)
		</div>

		<p>More simply put, the regional chapter is basically the first &acirc;&euro;&oelig;city chapter&acirc;&euro; in a region, a chapter that is focused on generating more city chapters around it. Therefore, in addition to reading this section, you are also advised to read the city chapter section as well.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>In order to get started, and assuming a chapter does not yet exist in your region, please follow the steps listed below:</p><br />

		<div>
			<strong>1. Contact the national chapter coordination</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			The title pretty much says it all... If you cannot find, or do not receive a response from, your national chapter, which you should be able to find listed on our official chapter list here: <a target="_blank" href="http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/chapters">http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/chapters</a> then please get in contact with us by sending an email to <script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[

			</script></span>, and with all likelihood start considering creating a chapter in your own country.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			If you indeed manage to establish contact successfully, please follow the instructions provided to you in the response.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>2. Set up communication tools</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			Communication tools refer to any virtual medium that provides a platform for exchanging group information. Unfortunately little can be expanded here as development of these platforms is in accordance with the tools used by national chapters since much of the best communication tools for regional chapters are indeed created by national chapters themselves, which differ in their approaches.
		</div><br />

		<div>
			However, such communication tools include, at the very minimum, a Facebook page and a blog site where basic public promotion can take place. Please review &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Chapter Website&acirc;&euro; guidelines at the end of this document if you intend to open a blog or a similar simple website.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			Additionally to this, as a coordinator for your region, you must create a dedicated email for that chapter and also a spreadsheet or some document in which you can at the very least keep track of details of city chapters (their contacts/chapter email, communication medium, coordinators, etc.)
		</div><br />

		<div>
			<strong>3. Organize a development plan or development guidelines and apply it</strong>
		</div>

		<div>
			After properly informing your national chapter of your intentions, following the instructions, and setting up communication mediums for your regional chapter, it is time to draft an initial development plan.&nbsp;
		</div><br />

		<div>
			This development plan should include, but not be limited to, details such as:&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			- Writing a promotional email and a some instructions and sending it to all subscribers from your region that may already be subscribed to the national chapter (in some chapters you can easily get hundreds of recipients)
		</div>

		<div>
			- Using the national chapter Facebook page to promote your regional one&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			- Feeding your social media with content updates and news from the movement&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			- Organizing a planning meeting and also small events that you can perform&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			- Outline a basic workflow of how you plan to organize and gather volunteers to create city chapters&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div>
			- Investigate what other actions your chapter can join in (please check <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tzmchapters.net/">www.tzmchapters.net</a> for more ideas and current global campaigns)&nbsp;
		</div>

		<p>And that's about as far as this guide can take you at the moment. What you do from this point on falls under your creative, planning and thinking skills.</p><br />

		<h2><a name="keeping-focus" id="keeping-focus"></a>3.3 - Keeping Focus</h2>

		<p>When it becomes necessary to establish regional Chapters, or when they simply emerge, these have the advantageous alternative of coordinating activities that transcend city boundaries, and help to distribute information from the cities to the national Chapter and vice-versa. However, the objective must always be to create more city Chapters, and even &acirc;&euro;&oelig;neighbourhood Chapters&acirc;&euro; if this is possible, to be able to carry out local activities such as town hall meetings and lectures. The regional Chapters share the same general functions as the city and national Chapters, but these functions will depend on the geography of the region. If it is a small region where the cities are right next to each other, one of the functions of the regional Chapter will be to carry out regional events. However, if it is a large region where cities are far apart, the regional Chapter must focus on virtual projects and on gathering people from different cities in the region
		to promote the creation of more city Chapters in the region. The regional Chapter should be used as a tool to expand the Movement, either to help a national Chapter to form new city Chapters in the region, or to help a city Chapter to grow and contact more people to form other city and regional Chapters to consolidate a national Chapter.</p>
